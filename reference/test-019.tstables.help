Collect PSI/SI tables from an MPEG transport stream

Usage: tstables [options] [filename]

Parameter:

  Input MPEG capture file (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  --all-once
      Same as --all-sections but collect each section only once per combination
      of PID, table id, table id extension, section number and version.

  -a
  --all-sections
      Display/save all sections, as they appear in the stream. By default,
      collect complete tables, with all sections of the tables grouped and
      ordered and collect each version of a table only once. Note that this
      mode is incompatible with --xml-output since valid XML structures may
      contain complete tables only.

  -b filename
  --binary-output filename
      Save sections in the specified binary output file. See also option -m,
      --multiple-files.

  -c
  --c-style
      Same as --raw-dump (no interpretation of section) but dump the bytes in
      C-language style.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting DVB strings without
      explicit character table code. According to DVB standard ETSI EN 300 468,
      the default DVB character set is ISO-6937. However, some bogus
      signalization may assume that the default character set is different,
      typically the usual local character table for the region. This option
      forces a non-standard character table. The available table names are
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret private descriptors.
      The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not case-sensitive) names.
      Must be one of "CanalPlus", "EACEM", "EICTA", "Eutelsat", "Logiways",
      "Nagra", "TPS".

  -d
  --diversified-payload
      Select only sections with "diversified" payload. This means that section
      payloads containing the same byte value (all 0x00 or all 0xFF for
      instance) are ignored. Typically, such sections are stuffing and can be
      ignored that way.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --exclude-current
      Exclude short sections and long sections with "current" indicator. This
      is rarely necessary. See also --include-next.

  --fill-eit
      Before exiting, add missing empty sections in EIT's and flush them. This
      can be useful with segmented EIT schedule where empty sections at end of
      segments are usually not transmitted.

  -f
  --flush
      Flush output after each display.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --include-next
      Include long sections with "next" indicator. By default, they are
      excluded.

  -i address:port
  --ip-udp address:port
      Send binary tables over UDP/IP to the specified destination. The
      'address' specifies an IP address which can be either unicast or
      multicast. It can be also a host name that translates to an IP address.
      The 'port' specifies the destination UDP port.

  --local-udp address
      With --ip-udp, when the destination is a multicast address, specify the
      IP address of the outgoing local interface. It can be also a host name
      that translates to a local address.

  --log
      Display a short one-line log of each table instead of full table display.

  --log-size value
      With option --log, specify how many bytes are displayed at the beginning
      of the table payload (the header is not displayed). The default is 8
      bytes.

  -x value
  --max-tables value
      Maximum number of tables to dump. Stop logging tables when this limit is
      reached.

  -m
  --multiple-files
      Create multiple binary output files, one per section. A binary output
      file name must be specified (option -b or --binary-output). Assuming that
      the specified file name has the form 'base.ext', each file is created
      with the name 'base_pXXXX_tXX.ext' for short sections and
      'base_pXXXX_tXX_eXXXX_vXX_sXX.ext' for long sections, where the XX
      specify the hexadecimal values of the PID, TID (table id), TIDext (table
      id extension), version and section index.

  --negate-pid
      Negate the PID filter: specified PID's are excluded. Warning: this can be
      a dangerous option on complete transport streams since PID's not
      containing sections can be accidentally selected.

  -n
  --negate-tid
      Negate the TID filter: specified TID's are excluded.

  --negate-tid-ext
      Negate the TID extension filter: specified TID extensions are excluded.

  --nested-tlv[=min-size]
      With option --tlv, try to interpret the value field of each TLV record as
      another TLV area. If the min-size value is specified, the nested TLV
      interpretation is performed only on value fields larger than this size.
      The syntax of the nested TLV is the same as the enclosing TLV.

  --no-duplicate
      Do not report consecutive identical tables with a short section in the
      same PID. This can be useful for ECM's. This is the way to display new
      ECM's only. By default, tables with long sections are reported only when
      a new version is detected but tables with a short section are all
      reported.

  --no-encapsulation
      With --ip-udp, send the tables as raw binary messages in UDP packets. By
      default, the tables are formatted into TLV messages.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  -o value
  --output-file value
      Save the tables or sections in human-readable text format in the
      specified file. By default, when no output option is specified, text is
      produced on the standard output. If you need text formatting on the
      standard output in addition to other output like binary files or UPD/IP,
      explicitly specify this option with "-" as output file name.
      
      By default, the tables are interpreted and formatted as text on the
      standard output. Several destinations can be specified at the same time:
      human-readable text output, binary output, UDP/IP messages.

  --pack-all-sections
      Same as --all-sections but also modify each long section so that it
      becomes a valid complete table. Its section_number and
      last_section_number are forced to zero. Use with care because this may
      create inconsistent tables. This option can be useful with tables with
      sparse sections such as EIT's to save them in XML format (as an
      alternative, see also --fill-eit).

  --pack-and-flush
      Before exiting, pack incomplete tables, ignoring missing sections, and
      flush them. Use with care because this may create inconsistent tables.
      Unlike option --pack-all-sections, --pack-and-flush does not force
      --all-sections because it only applies to the last incomplete tables
      before exiting.

  --packet-index
      Display the index of the first and last TS packet of each displayed
      section or table.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      PID filter: select packets with this PID value or range of PID values.
      Several -p or --pid options may be specified. Without -p or --pid option,
      all PID's are used (this can be a dangerous option on complete transport
      streams since PID's not containing sections can be accidentally
      selected).

  --psi-si
      Add all PID's containing PSI/SI tables, ie. PAT, CAT, PMT, NIT, SDT and
      BAT. Note that EIT, TDT and TOT are not included. Use --pid 18 to get EIT
      and --pid 20 to get TDT and TOT.

  -r
  --raw-dump
      Raw dump of section, no interpretation.

  --rewrite-binary
      With --binary-output, rewrite the same file with each table. The
      specified file always contains one single table, the latest one.

  --rewrite-xml
      With --xml-output, rewrite the same file with each table. The specified
      file always contains one single table, the latest one.

  --strict-xml
      Save XML documents in strictly conformant XML format. By default, do not
      escape characters when this is not syntactically necessary to make the
      XML text more human-readable.

  --text-output value
      A synonym for --output-file.

  -t tid1[-tid2]
  --tid tid1[-tid2]
      TID filter: select sections with this TID (table id) value or range of
      TID values. Several -t or --tid options may be specified. Without -t or
      --tid option, all tables are saved.

  -e ext1[-ext2]
  --tid-ext ext1[-ext2]
      TID extension filter: select sections with this table id extension value
      or range of values (apply to long sections only). Several -e or --tid-ext
      options may be specified. Without -e or --tid-ext option, all tables are
      saved.

  --time-stamp
      Display a time stamp (current local time) with each table.

  --tlv value
      For sections of unknown types, this option specifies how to interpret
      some parts of the section payload as TLV records. Several --tlv options
      are allowed, each one describes a part of the section payload.
      
      Each syntax string has the form "start,size,tagSize,lengthSize,order".
      The start and size fields define the offset and size of the TLV area in
      the section payload. If the size field is "auto", the TLV extends up to
      the end of the section. If the start field is "auto", the longest TLV
      area in the section payload will be used. The fields tagSize and
      lengthSize indicate the size in bytes of the Tag and Length fields in the
      TLV structure. The field order must be either "msb" or "lsb" and
      indicates the byte order of the Tag and Length fields.
      
      All fields are optional. The default values are "auto,auto,1,1,msb".

  --ttl value
      With --ip-udp, specifies the TTL (Time-To-Live) socket option. The actual
      option is either "Unicast TTL" or "Multicast TTL", depending on the
      destination address. Remember that the default Multicast TTL is 1 on most
      systems.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.

  --xml-output filename
      Save the tables in XML format in the specified file. To output the XML
      text on the standard output, explicitly specify this option with "-" as
      output file name.
