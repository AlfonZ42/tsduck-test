Write packets to a file and pass them to next plugin

Usage: tsp -P file [options] file-name

Parameter:

  Name of the created output file.

Options:

  --add-start-stuffing count
      Specify that <count> null TS packets must be automatically inserted at
      the start of the output file, before what comes from the previous
      plugins.

  --add-stop-stuffing count
      Specify that <count> null TS packets must be automatically appended at
      the end of the output file, after what comes from the previous plugins.

  -a
  --append
      If the file already exists, append to the end of the file. By default,
      existing files are overwritten.

  --format name
      Specify the format of the output TS file. By default, the format is a
      standard TS file.
      Must be one of "M2TS", "RS204", "TS", "duck".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -k
  --keep
      Keep existing file (abort if the specified file already exists). By
      default, existing files are overwritten.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.
