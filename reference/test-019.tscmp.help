Compare two transport stream files

Usage: tscmp [options] filename-1 filename-2

Parameters:

  MPEG capture files to be compared.

Options:

  --buffered-packets value
      Specifies the files input buffer size in TS packets.
      The default is 10,000 TS packets.

  -b value
  --byte-offset value
      Start reading the files at the specified byte offset (default: 0).

  --cc-ignore
      Ignore continuity counters when comparing packets. Useful if one file has
      been resynchronized.

  -c
  --continue
      Continue the comparison up to the end of files. By default, stop after
      the first differing packet.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -d
  --dump
      Dump the content of all differing packets.

  -f name
  --format name
      Specify the format of the input files. By default, the format is
      automatically and independently detected for each file. But the
      auto-detection may fail in some cases (for instance when the first
      time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with 0x47). Using this option forces a
      specific format. If a specific format is specified, the two input files
      must have the same format.
      Must be one of "M2TS", "RS204", "TS", "autodetect", "duck".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -j
  --json
      Report in JSON output format (useful for automatic analysis).

  --json-line[='prefix']
      Same as --json but report the JSON text as one single line in the message
      logger instead of the output file. The optional string parameter
      specifies a prefix to prepend on the log line before the JSON text to
      locate the appropriate line in the logs.

  --json-udp address:port
      Same as --json but report the JSON text as one single line in a UDP
      datagram instead of the output file. The 'address' specifies an IP
      address which can be either unicast or multicast. It can be also a host
      name that translates to an IP address. The 'port' specifies the
      destination UDP port.

  --json-udp-local address
      With --json-udp, when the destination is a multicast address, specify the
      IP address of the outgoing local interface. It can be also a host name
      that translates to a local address.

  --json-udp-ttl value
      With --json-udp, specifies the TTL (Time-To-Live) socket option. The
      actual option is either "Unicast TTL" or "Multicast TTL", depending on
      the destination address. Remember that the default Multicast TTL is 1 on
      most systems.

  -n
  --normalized
      Report in a normalized output format (useful for automatic analysis).

  -p value
  --packet-offset value
      Start reading the files at the specified TS packet (default: 0).

  --payload-only
      Compare only the payload of the packets, ignore header and adaptation
      field.

  --pcr-ignore
      Ignore PCR and OPCR when comparing packets. Useful if one file has been
      resynchronized.

  --pid-ignore
      Ignore PID value when comparing packets. Useful if one file has gone
      through a remapping process.

  -q
  --quiet
      Do not output any message. The process simply terminates with a success
      status if the files are identical and a failure status if they differ.

  -s
  --subset
      Specifies that the second file is a subset of the first one. This means
      that the second file is expected to be identical to the first one, except
      that some packets may be missing. When a difference is found, the first
      file is read ahead until a matching packet is found.
      See also --threshold-diff.

  -t value
  --threshold-diff value
      When used with --subset, this value specifies the maximum number of
      differing bytes in packets to declare them equal. When two packets have
      more differing bytes than this threshold, the packets are reported as
      different and the first file is read ahead. The default is zero, which
      means that two packets must be strictly identical to declare them equal.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.
