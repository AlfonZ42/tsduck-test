Verify PCR's from TS packets

Usage: tsp -P pcrverify [options]

Options:

  -a
  --absolute
      Use absolute values in PCR unit. By default, use micro-second equivalent
      values (one micro-second = 27 PCR units).

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Verify the PCR's according to this transport bitrate. By default, use the
      input bitrate as reported by the input device.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -j value
  --jitter-max value
      Maximum allowed jitter. PCR's with a higher jitter are reported, others
      are ignored. If --absolute, the specified value is in PCR units,
      otherwise it is in micro-seconds. The default is 27,000 PCR units or 1,
      000 micro-seconds.

  -p value
  --pid value
      PID filter: select packets with this PID value. Several -p or --pid
      options may be specified. Without -p or --pid option, PCR's from all
      PID's are used.

  -t
  --time-stamp
      Display time of each event.
