Perform various transformations on the PMT

Usage: tsp -P pmt [options]

Options:

  --ac3-atsc2dvb
      Change the description of AC-3 audio streams from ATSC to DVB method. In
      details, this means that all components with stream_type 0x81 are
      modified with stream_type 0x06 (PES private data) and an AC-3_descriptor
      is added on this component (if none was already there).

  --add-ca-descriptor casid/pid[/private-data]
      Add a CA_descriptor at program level in the PMT with the specified CA
      System Id and ECM PID. The optional private data must be a suite of
      hexadecimal digits. Several --add-ca-descriptor options may be specified
      to add several descriptors.

  -a pid/stream_type
  --add-pid pid/stream_type
      Add the specified PID / stream-type component in the PMT. Several
      --add-pid options may be specified to add several components.

  --add-programinfo-id value
      Add a registration_descriptor in the program-level descriptor list in the
      PMT. The value is the format_identifier in registration_descriptor, e.g.
      0x43554549 for CUEI.

  --add-stream-identifier
      Add a stream_identifier_descriptor on all components. The component_tag
      are uniquely allocated inside the service. Existing stream_identifier
      descriptors are left unmodified.

  --audio-language language-code[:audio-type[:location]]
      Specifies the language for an audio stream in the PMT. Several options
      can be specified to set the languages of several audio streams.
      
      The "language-code" is a 3-character string. The audio-type is optional,
      its default value is zero. The "location" indicates how to locate the
      audio stream. Its format is either "Pn" or "An". In the first case, "n"
      designates a PID value and in the second case the audio stream number
      inside the PMT, starting with 1. The default location is "A1", ie. the
      first audio stream inside the PMT.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate in bits / second of the PMT PID if a new one is
      created. The default is 3,000 b/s.

  --cleanup-private-descriptors
      Remove all private descriptors without preceding private_data_specifier
      descriptor.

  -c
  --create
      Create a new empty PMT if none was received after one second. This is
      equivalent to --create-after 1000.

  --create-after value
      Create a new empty PMT if none was received after the specified number of
      milliseconds. If the actual PMT is received later, it will be used as the
      base for transformations instead of the empty one.

  --eac3-atsc2dvb
      Change the description of Enhanced-AC-3 (aka AC-3+ or DD+) audio streams
      from ATSC to DVB method. In details, this means that all components with
      stream_type 0x87 are modified with stream_type 0x06 (PES private data)
      and an enhanced_AC-3_descriptor is added on this component (if none was
      already there).

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --increment-version
      Increment the version number of the PMT.

  --inter-packet value
      When a new PMT is created and --bitrate is not present, this option
      specifies the packet interval for the PID, that is to say the number of
      TS packets in the transport between two packets of the PID. Use instead
      of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be determined.

  -m old-pid/new-pid
  --move-pid old-pid/new-pid
      Change the PID value of a component in the PMT. Several --move-pid
      options may be specified to move several components.

  -i value
  --new-service-id value
      Change the service id in the PMT.

  -v value
  --new-version value
      Specify a new value for the version of the PMT.

  --pcr-pid value
      Change the PCR PID value in the PMT.

  --pds value
      With option --remove-descriptor, specify the private data specifier which
      applies to the descriptor tag values above 0x80.

  -p value
  --pmt-pid value
      Specify the PID carrying the PMT to modify. All PMT's in this PID will be
      modified. Options --pmt-pid and --service are mutually exclusive. If
      neither are specified, the first service in the PAT is used.

  --remove-descriptor value
      Remove from the PMT all descriptors with the specified tag. Several
      --remove-descriptor options may be specified to remove several types of
      descriptors. See also option --pds.

  -r value
  --remove-pid value
      Remove the component with the specified PID from the PMT. Several
      --remove-pid options may be specified to remove several components.

  --remove-stream-type value[-value]
      Remove all components with a stream type matching the specified value (or
      in the specified range of values). Several --remove-stream-type options
      may be specified.

  -s name-or-id
  --service name-or-id
      Specify the service the PMT of which must be modified. If the argument is
      an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a
      service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name, as specified
      in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are ignored.
      Options --pmt-pid and --service are mutually exclusive. If neither are
      specified, the first service in the PAT is used.

  --set-cue-type pid/type
      In the component with the specified PID, add an SCTE 35 cue_identifier
      descriptor with the specified cue stream type. Several --set-cue-type
      options may be specified.

  --set-data-broadcast-id pid/id[/selector]
      In the component with the specified PID, add a
      data_broadcast_id_descriptor with the specified data_broadcast_id. The
      optional selector is a suite of hexadecimal characters representing the
      content of the selector bytes. Several --set-data-broadcast-id options
      may be specified.

  --set-stream-identifier pid/id
      In the component with the specified PID, add a
      stream_identifier_descriptor with the specified id. Several
      --set-stream-identifier options may be specified.
