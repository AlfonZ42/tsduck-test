Regulate the TS packets flow based on PCR or bitrate

Usage: tsp -P regulate [options]

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specify a bitrate in b/s and regulate (slow down only) the TS packets
      flow according to this bitrate. By default, use the "input" bitrate,
      typically resulting from the PCR analysis of the input file.

  -p value
  --packet-burst value
      Number of packets to burst at a time. Does not modify the average output
      bitrate but influence smoothing and CPU load. The default is 16 packets.

  --pcr-synchronous
      Regulate the flow based on the Program Clock Reference from the transport
      stream. By default, use a bitrate, not PCR's.

  --pid-pcr value
      With --pcr-synchronous, specify the reference PID for PCR's. By default,
      use the first PID containing PCR's.

  -w value
  --wait-min value
      With --pcr-synchronous, specify the minimum wait time in milli-seconds.
      The default is 50 ms.
