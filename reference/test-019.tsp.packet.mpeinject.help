Inject an incoming UDP stream into MPE (Multi-Protocol Encapsulation)

Usage: tsp -P mpeinject [options] [address:]port

Parameter:

  The parameter [address:]port describes the destination of UDP packets to
  receive. The 'port' part is mandatory and specifies the UDP port to listen
  on. The 'address' part is optional. It specifies an IP multicast address to
  listen on. It can be also a host name that translates to a multicast address.

UDP reception options:

  -b value
  --buffer-size value
      Specify the UDP socket receive buffer size (socket option).

  --default-interface
      Let the system find the appropriate local interface on which to listen.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  -f
  --first-source
      Filter UDP packets based on the source address. Use the sender address of
      the first received packet as only allowed source. This option is useful
      when several sources send packets to the same destination address and port.
      Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and only one
      sender shall be accepted. To allow a more precise selection of the sender,
      use option --source. Options --first-source and --source are mutually
      exclusive.

  -l address
  --local-address address
      Specify the IP address of the local interface on which to listen.
      It can be also a host name that translates to a local address.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely necessary.

  -r
  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the option
      is present for legacy only.

  -s address[:port]
  --source address[:port]
      Filter UDP packets based on the specified source address. This option is
      useful when several sources send packets to the same destination address
      and port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and
      only one sender shall be accepted. Options --first-source and --source
      are mutually exclusive.

MPE encapsulation options:

  --mac-address nn:nn:nn:nn:nn:nn
      Specify the default destination MAC address to set in MPE sections for
      unicast IP packets. The default is 00:00:00:00:00:00. For multicast IP
      packets, the MAC address is automatically computed.

  --new-destination address[:port]
      Change the destination IP address and UDP port in MPE sections. If the
      port is not specified, the original destination port from the UDP datagram
      is used. By default, the destination address is not modified.

  --new-source address[:port]
      Change the source IP address and UDP port in MPE sections. If the port is
      not specified, the original source port from the UDP datagram is used. By
      default, the source address is not modified.

Other options:

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --max-queue value
      Specify the maximum number of queued UDP datagrams before their insertion
      into the MPE stream. The default is 32.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the PID into which the MPE datagrams shall be inserted. This is a
      mandatory parameter.

  --replace
      Replace the target PID if it exists. By default, the plugin only replaces
       null packets and tsp stops with an error if incoming packets are found
       with the target PID.

  --version
      Display the version number.
