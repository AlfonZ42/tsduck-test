Filter TS packets according to various conditions

Usage: tsp -P filter [options]

Options:

  --adaptation-field
      Select packets with an adaptation field.

  --after-packets count
      Let the first 'count' packets pass transparently without filtering. Start
      to apply the filtering criteria after that number of packets.

  -c
  --clear
      Select clear (unscrambled) packets. Equivalent to --scrambling-control 0.

  --every count
      Select one packet every that number of packets.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --input-stuffing
      Select packets which were articially inserted as stuffing before the
      input plugin (using tsp options --add-start-stuffing,
      --add-input-stuffing and --add-stop-stuffing). Be aware that these
      packets may no longer be null packets if some previous plugin injected
      data, replacing stuffing.

  -l label1[-label2]
  --label label1[-label2]
      Select packets with any of the specified labels. Labels should have
      typically be set by a previous plugin in the chain. Several --label
      options may be specified.
      
      Note that the option --label is different from the generic option
      --only-label. The generic option --only-label acts at tsp level and
      controls which packets are passed to the plugin. All other packets are
      directly passed to the next plugin without going through this plugin. The
      option --label, on the other hand, is specific to the filter plugin and
      selects packets with specific labels among the packets which are passed
      to this plugin.

  --max-adaptation-field-size value
      Select packets with no adaptation field or with an adaptation field the
      size (in bytes) of which is not greater than the specified value.

  --max-payload-size value
      Select packets with no payload or with a payload the size (in bytes) of
      which is not greater than the specified value.

  --min-adaptation-field-size value
      Select packets with an adaptation field the size (in bytes) of which is
      equal to or greater than the specified value.

  --min-payload-size value
      Select packets with a payload the size (in bytes) of which is equal to or
      greater than the specified value.

  -n
  --negate
      Negate the filter: specified packets are excluded.

  --nullified
      Select packets which were explicitly turned into null packets by some
      previous plugin in the chain (typically using a --stuffing option).

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  --payload
      Select packets with a payload.

  --pcr
      Select packets with PCR or OPCR.

  --pes
      Select packets with clear PES headers.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      PID filter: select packets with these PID values. Several -p or --pid
      options may be specified.

  --reset-label label1[-label2]
      Clear the specified labels on the selected packets. Do not drop
      unselected packets, simply clear labels on selected ones. Several
      --reset-label options may be specified.

  --scrambling-control value
      Select packets with the specified scrambling control value. Valid values
      are 0 (clear), 1 (reserved), 2 (even key), 3 (odd key).

  --set-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on the selected packets. Do not drop unselected
      packets, simply mark selected ones. Several --set-label options may be
      specified.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Replace excluded packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing
      them. Useful to preserve bitrate.

  --unit-start
      Select packets with payload unit start indicator.

  -v
  --valid
      Select valid packets. A valid packet starts with 0x47 and has its
      transport_error_indicator cleared.
