Reduce the TS bitrate by removing stuffing packets

Usage: tsp -P reduce [options] rempkt inpkt

Parameters:

  The parameters specify that <rempkt> TS packets must be automatically removed
  after every <inpkt> input TS packets in the transport stream. Only stuffing
  packets can be removed. Both <rempkt> and <inpkt> must be non-zero integer
  values.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.
