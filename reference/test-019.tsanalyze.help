Analyze the structure of a transport stream

Usage: tsanalyze [options] [filename]

Input file:

  MPEG capture file (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate of the transport stream in bits/second
      (based on 188-byte packets). By default, the bitrate is
      evaluated using the PCR in the transport stream.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the version number.

Controlling analysis:

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting DVB strings without
      explicit character table code. According to DVB standard ETSI EN 300 468,
      the default DVB character set is ISO-6937. However, some bogus
      signalization may assume that the default character set is different,
      typically the usual local character table for the region. This option
      forces a non-standard character table. The available table names are:
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5,
      ISO-8859-6, ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --suspect-max-consecutive value
      Specifies the maximum number of consecutive "suspect" packets.
      The default value is 1. If set to zero, the suspect packet detection
      is disabled.

      Suspect packets are TS packets which are technically correct but which
      may be suspected of being incorrect, resulting in analysis errors.
      Typically, in the middle of a suite of packets with uncorrectable
      binary errors, one packet may appear to have no such error while
      it has some errors in fact. To avoid adding this type of packets in the
      analysis, a packet is declared as "suspect" (and consequently ignored in
      the analysis) when:
      - its PID is unknown (no other packet was found in this PID)
      - it immediately follows a certain amount of packet containing errors
        (see option --suspect-min-error-count)
      - it immediately follows no more than the specified number consecutive
        suspect packets.

  --suspect-min-error-count value
      Specifies the minimum number of consecutive packets with errors before
      starting "suspect" packet detection. See also option
      --suspect-max-consecutive. The default value is 1. If set to zero,
      the suspect packet detection is disabled.

Controlling output:

  The output can include full synthetic analysis (options *-analysis),
  fully normalized output (option --normalized) or a simple list of
  values on one line (options --*-list). The second and third type of
  options are useful to write automated scripts.

  If output-control options are specified, only the selected outputs
  are produced. If no option is given, the default is:
  --ts-analysis --service-analysis --pid-analysis --table-analysis

  --ts-analysis
      Report global transport stream analysis.

  --service-analysis
      Report analysis for each service.

  --pid-analysis
      Report analysis for each PID.

  --table-analysis
      Report analysis for each table.

  --error-analysis
      Report analysis about detected errors.

  --normalized
      Complete report about the transport stream, the services and
      the PID's in a normalized output format (useful for automatic
      analysis).

  --service-list
      Report the list of all service ids.

  --pid-list
      Report the list of all PID's.

  --global-pid-list
      Report the list of all global PID's, that is to say PID's
      which are not referenced by a specific service but are or
      are referenced by the standard DVB PSI/SI. This include, for
      instance, PID's of the PAT, EMM's, EIT's, stuffing, etc.

  --unreferenced-pid-list
      Report the list of all unreferenced PID's, that is to say
      PID's which are neither referenced by a service nor known
      as or referenced by the standard DVB PSI/SI.

  --service-pid-list value
      Report the list of all PID's which are referenced by the
      specified service id.

  --pes-pid-list
      Report the list of all PID's which are declared as carrying
      PES packets (audio, video, subtitles, etc).

  --title string
      Display the specified string as title header.

  --prefix string
      For one-line displays (options --*-list), prepend the
      specified string to all values. For instance, options
      --global --prefix -p outputs something like '-p 0 -p 1 -p 16',
      which is an acceptable option list for the tsp filter plugin.
