Generate HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) media

Usage: tsp -O hls [options] filename

Parameter:

  Specify the name template of the output media segment files. A number is
  automatically added to the name part so that successive segment files receive
  distinct names. Example: if the specified file name is foo-.ts, the various
  segment files are named foo-000000.ts, foo-000001.ts, etc.

  If the specified template already contains trailing digits, this unmodified
  name is used for the first segment. Then, the integer part is incremented.
  Example: if the specified file name is foo-027.ts, the various segment files
  are named foo-027.ts, foo-028.ts, etc.

Options:

  -d value
  --duration value
      Specify the target duration in seconds of media segments. The default is
      10 seconds per segment for VoD streams and 5 seconds for live streams.

  -f value
  --fixed-segment-size value
      Specify the size in bytes of all media segments. By default, the segment
      size is variable and based on the --duration parameter. When
      --fixed-segment-size is specified, the --duration parameter is only used
      as a hint in the playlist file.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --label-close label1[-label2]
      Close the current segment as soon as possible after a packet with any of
      the specified labels. Labels should have typically been set by a previous
      plugin in the chain. Several --label-close options may be specified.

      In practice, the current segment is closed and renewed at the start of
      the next PES packet on the video PID. This option is compatible with
      --duration. The current segment is closed on a labelled packed or segment
      duration, whichever comes first.

  -l value
  --live value
      Specify that the output is a live stream. The specified value indicates
      the number of simultaneously available media segments. Obsolete media
      segment files are automatically deleted. By default, the output stream is
      considered as VoD and all created media segments are preserved.

  -p filename
  --playlist filename
      Specify the name of the playlist file. The playlist file is rewritten
      each time a new segment file is completed or an obsolete one is deleted.
      The playlist and the segment files can be written to distinct directories
      but, in all cases, the URI of the segment files in the playlist are
      always relative to the playlist location. By default, no playlist file is
      created (media segments only).

  -s value
  --start-media-sequence value
      Initial media sequence number in #EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE directive in the
      playlist. The default is zero.
