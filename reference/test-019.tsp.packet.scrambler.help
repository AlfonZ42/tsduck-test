DVB scrambler

Usage: tsp -P scrambler [options] [service]

Parameter:

  Specifies the optional service to scramble. If no service is specified, a
  list of PID's to scramble must be provided using --pid options. When PID's
  are provided, fixed control words must be specified as well.
  
  If no fixed CW is specified, a random CW is generated for each crypto-period
  and ECM's containing the current and next CW's are created and inserted in
  the stream. ECM's can be created only when a service is specified.
  
  If the argument is an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is
  interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name,
  as specified in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are
  ignored. If the input TS does not contain an SDT, use service ids only.

Options:

  -a value
  --access-criteria value
      Specifies the access criteria for the service as sent to the ECMG. The
      value must be a suite of hexadecimal digits.

  --atis-idsa
      Use ATIS-IDSA scrambling (ATIS-0800006) instead of DVB-CSA2 (the
      default). The control words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.

  -b value
  --bitrate-ecm value
      Specifies the bitrate for ECM PID's in bits / second. The default is 30,
      000 b/s.

  --channel-id value
      Specifies the DVB SimulCrypt ECM_channel_id for the ECMG (default: 1).

  --component-level
      Add CA_descriptors at component level in the PMT. By default, the
      CA_descriptor is added at program level.

  -d seconds
  --cp-duration seconds
      Specifies the crypto-period duration in seconds (default: 10).

  -c value
  --cw value
      Specifies a fixed and constant control word for all TS packets. The value
      must be a string of 16 hexadecimal digits (32 digits with --atis-idsa).

  -f name
  --cw-file name
      Specifies a text file containing the list of control words to apply. Each
      line of the file must contain exactly 16 hexadecimal digits (32 digits
      with --atis-idsa or --dvb-cissa). The next control word is used each time
      the "scrambling_control" changes in the TS packets header. When all
      control words are used, the first one is used again, and so on.

  --dvb-cissa
      Use DVB-CISSA scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2 (the default). The control
      words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.

  --dvb-csa2
      Use DVB-CSA2 scrambling. This is the default.

  -i value
  --ecm-id value
      Specifies the DVB SimulCrypt ECM_id for the ECMG (default: 1).

  -e host:port
  --ecmg host:port
      Specify an ECM Generator host name and port.

  -v value
  --ecmg-scs-version value
      Specifies the version of the ECMG <=> SCS DVB SimulCrypt protocol. Valid
      values are 2 and 3. The default is 2.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-scrambled
      Ignore packets which are already scrambled. Since these packets are
      likely scrambled with a different control word, descrambling will not be
      possible the usual way.

  --log-data[=level]
      Same as --log-protocol but applies to CW_provision and ECM_response
      messages only. To debug the session management without being flooded by
      data messages, use --log-protocol=info --log-data=debug.
      Must be one of "debug", "error", "fatal", "info", "severe", "verbose",
      "warning".

  --log-protocol[=level]
      Log all ECMG <=> SCS protocol messages using the specified level. If the
      option is not present, the messages are logged at debug level only. If
      the option is present without value, the messages are logged at info
      level. A level can be a numerical debug level or a name.
      Must be one of "debug", "error", "fatal", "info", "severe", "verbose",
      "warning".

  --no-audio
      Do not scramble audio components in the selected service. By default, all
      audio components are scrambled.

  -n
  --no-entropy-reduction
      With DVB-CSA2, do not perform control word entropy reduction to 48 bits.
      Keep full 64-bit control words. Ignored with --atis-idsa or --dvb-cissa.

  --no-video
      Do not scramble video components in the selected service. By default, all
      video components are scrambled.

  --partial-scrambling count
      Do not scramble all packets, only one packet every "count" packets. The
      default value is 1, meaning that all packets are scrambled. Specifying
      higher values is a way to reduce the scrambling CPU load while keeping
      the service mostly scrambled.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Scramble packets with these PID values. Several -p or --pid options may
      be specified. By default, scramble the specified service.

  --pid-ecm value
      Specifies the new ECM PID for the service. By defaut, use the first
      unused PID immediately following the PMT PID. Using the default, there is
      a risk to later discover that this PID is already used. In that case,
      specify --pid-ecm with a notoriously unused PID value.

  --private-data value
      Specifies the private data to insert in the CA_descriptor in the PMT. The
      value must be a suite of hexadecimal digits.

  --stream-id value
      Specifies the DVB SimulCrypt ECM_stream_id for the ECMG (default: 1).

  --subtitles
      Scramble subtitles components in the selected service. By default, the
      subtitles components are not scrambled.

  -s value
  --super-cas-id value
      Specify the DVB SimulCrypt Super_CAS_Id. This is required when --ecmg is
      specified.

  --synchronous
      Specify to synchronously generate the ECM's. By default, in real-time
      mode, the packet processing continues while generating ECM's. This option
      is always on in offline mode.
