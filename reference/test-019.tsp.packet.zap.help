Zap on one service: Produce an SPTS containing only the specified service

Usage: tsp -P zap [options] service

Parameter:

  Specifies the service to keep. If the argument is an integer value (either
  decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is
  interpreted as a service name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case
  sensitive and blanks are ignored. If the input TS does not contain an SDT,
  use a service id.

Options:

  -a value
  --audio value
      Remove all audio components except the specified one. The name is a
      three-letters language code. By default, keep all audio components. This
      option and the --audio-pid option are mutually exclusive.

  --audio-pid value
      Remove all audio components except the specified audio PID. By default,
      keep all audio components. This option and the --audio option are
      mutually exclusive.

  -c
  --cas
      Keep Conditional Access System sections (CAT and EMM's). Remove them by
      default. Note that the ECM's for the specified service are always kept.

  --eit
      Keep EIT sections for the specified service. EIT sections for other
      services are removed. By default, all EIT's are removed.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -e
  --no-ecm
      Remove all ECM PID's. By default, keep all ECM PID's.

  -n
  --no-subtitles
      Remove all subtitles. By default, keep all subtitles.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -p
  --pes-only
      Keep only the PES elementary streams (audio, video, subtitles). Remove
      all PSI/SI and CAS information.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Replace excluded packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing
      them. Useful to preserve bitrate.

  -t value
  --subtitles value
      Remove all subtitles except the specified one. The name is a
      three-letters language code. By default, keep all subtitles.
