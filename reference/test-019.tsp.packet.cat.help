Perform various transformations on the CAT

Usage: tsp -P cat [options]

Options:

  -a casid/pid[/private-data]
  --add-ca-descriptor casid/pid[/private-data]
      Add a CA_descriptor in the CAT with the specified CA System Id and EMM
      PID. The optional private data must be a suite of hexadecimal digits.
      Several --add-ca-descriptor options may be specified to add several
      descriptors.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate in bits / second of the CAT if a new one is
      created. The default is 3,000 b/s.

  --cleanup-private-descriptors
      Remove all private descriptors without preceding private_data_specifier
      descriptor.

  -c
  --create
      Create a new empty CAT if none was received after one second. This is
      equivalent to --create-after 1000.

  --create-after value
      e a new empty CAT if none was received after the specified number of
      milliseconds. This can be useful to force the creation of a CAT in a TS
      that has none (the CAT is an optional table). If an actual CAT is
      received later, it will be used as the base for transformations instead
      of the empty one.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --increment-version
      Increment the version number of the CAT.

  --inter-packet value
      When a new CAT is created and --bitrate is not present, this option
      specifies the packet interval for the CAT PID, that is to say the number
      of TS packets in the transport between two packets of the CAT PID. Use
      instead of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be
      determined.

  -v value
  --new-version value
      Specify a new value for the version of the CAT.

  -r value
  --remove-casid value
      Remove all CA_descriptors with the specified CA System Id. Several
      --remove-casid options may be specified.

  --remove-pid value
      Remove all CA_descriptors with the specified EMM PID value. Several
      --remove-pid options may be specified.
