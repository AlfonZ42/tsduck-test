Evaluate the bitrate of a transport stream

Usage: tsbitrate [options] [filename]

Input file:

  MPEG capture file (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  -a
  --all
      Analyze all packets in the input file. By default, stop analysis when
      enough PCR information has been collected.

  -d
  --dts
      Use DTS (Decoding Time Stamps) from video PID's instead of PCR
      (Program Clock Reference) from the transport layer.

  -f
  --full
      Full analysis. The file is entirely analyzed (as with --all) and the
      final report includes a complete per PID bitrate analysis.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --min-pcr value
      Stop analysis when that number of PCR are read from the required
      minimum number of PID (default: 64).

  --min-pid value
      Minimum number of PID to get PCR from (default: 1).

  -v
  --value-only
      Display only the bitrate value, in bits/seconds, based on
      188-byte packets. Useful to reuse the value in command lines.

  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the version number.
