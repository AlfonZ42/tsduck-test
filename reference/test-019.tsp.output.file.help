Write packets to a file

Usage: tsp -O file [options] [file-name]

Parameter:

  Name of the created output file. Use standard output by default.

Options:

  -a
  --append
      If the file already exists, append to the end of the file. By default,
      existing files are overwritten.

  --format name
      Specify the format of the created file. By default, the format is a
      standard TS file.
      Must be one of "M2TS", "TS", "autodetect", "duck".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -k
  --keep
      Keep existing file (abort if the specified file already exists). By
      default, existing files are overwritten.

  --max-retry value
      With --reopen-on-error, specify the maximum number of times the file is
      reopened on error. By default, the file is indefinitely reopened.

  -r
  --reopen-on-error
      In case of write error, close the file and try to reopen it several
      times. After a write error, attempt to reopen or recreate the file
      immediately. Then, in case of open error, periodically retry to open the
      file. See also options --retry-interval and --max-retry.

  --retry-interval milliseconds
      With --reopen-on-error, specify the number of milliseconds to wait before
      attempting to reopen the file after a failure. The default is 2,000
      milliseconds.
