Receive TS packets from UDP/IP, multicast or unicast

Usage: tsp -I ip [options] [address:]port

Parameter:

  The parameter [address:]port describes the destination of UDP packets to
  receive. The 'port' part is mandatory and specifies the UDP port to listen
  on. The 'address' part is optional. It specifies an IP multicast address to
  listen on. It can be also a host name that translates to a multicast address.
  An optional source address can be specified as 'source@address:port' in the
  case of SSM.

UDP reception options:

  -b value
  --buffer-size value
      Specify the UDP socket receive buffer size (socket option).

  --default-interface
      Let the system find the appropriate local interface on which to listen.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  -f
  --first-source
      Filter UDP packets based on the source address. Use the sender address of
      the first received packet as only allowed source. This option is useful
      when several sources send packets to the same destination address and port.
      Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and only one
      sender shall be accepted. To allow a more precise selection of the sender,
      use option --source. Options --first-source and --source are mutually
      exclusive.

  -l address
  --local-address address
      Specify the IP address of the local interface on which to listen.
      It can be also a host name that translates to a local address.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely necessary.

  -r
  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the option
      is present for legacy only.

  -s address[:port]
  --source address[:port]
      Filter UDP packets based on the specified source address. This option is
      useful when several sources send packets to the same destination address
      and port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and
      only one sender shall be accepted. Options --first-source and --source
      are mutually exclusive.

  --ssm
      Force the usage of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) using the source which
      is specified by the option --source. The --ssm option is implicit when the
      syntax 'source@address:port' is used.

Other options:

  -d value
  --display-interval value
      Specify the interval in seconds between two displays of the evaluated
      real-time input bitrate. The default is to never display the bitrate.
      This option is ignored if --evaluation-interval is not specified.

  -e value
  --evaluation-interval value
      Specify that the real-time input bitrate shall be evaluated on a regular
      basis. The value specifies the number of seconds between two evaluations.
      By default, the real-time input bitrate is never evaluated and the input
      bitrate is evaluated from the PCR in the input packets.
