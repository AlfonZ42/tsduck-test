Regulate the TS packets flow to a specified bitrate

Usage: tsp -P regulate [options]

Regulate (slow down only) the TS packets flow according to a specified
bitrate. Useful to play a non-regulated input (such as a TS file) to a
non-regulated output device such as IP multicast.

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specify the bitrate in b/s. By default, use the "input" bitrate,
      typically resulting from the PCR analysis of the input file.

  --help

  -p value
  --packet-burst value
      Number of packets to burst at a time. Does not modify the average
      output bitrate but influence smoothing and CPU load. The default
      is 16 packets.

  --version
      Display the version number.
