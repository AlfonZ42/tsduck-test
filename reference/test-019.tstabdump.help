Dump PSI/SI tables, as saved by tstables

Usage: tstabdump [options] [filename ...]

Parameters:

  Input binary section file. Several files can be specified. By default,
  without file and without --ip-udp, the binary tables are read from the
  standard input.
  
  With --ip-udp, no file shall be specified. Binary sections and tables are
  received over UDP/IP as sent by the utility 'tstables' or the plugin
  'tables'.

Options:

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  --buffer-size value
      Specify the UDP socket receive buffer size (socket option).

  -c
  --c-style
      Same as --raw-dump (no interpretation of section) but dump the bytes in
      C-language style.

  --conax
      Interpret all EMM and ECM from unknown CAS as coming from Conax. By
      default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted according to the CA_descriptor
      which references their PID. This option is useful when analyzing partial
      transport streams without CAT or PMT to correctly identify the CA PID's.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting DVB strings without
      explicit character table code. According to DVB standard ETSI EN 300 468,
      the default DVB character set is ISO-6937. However, some bogus
      signalization may assume that the default character set is different,
      typically the usual local character table for the region. This option
      forces a non-standard character table. The available table names are
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --default-interface
      Let the system find the appropriate local interface on which to listen.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret private descriptors.
      The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not case-sensitive) names.
      Must be one of "CanalPlus", "EACEM", "EICTA", "Eutelsat", "Logiways",
      "Nagra", "TPS".

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --first-source
      Filter UDP packets based on the source address. Use the sender address of
      the first received packet as only allowed source. This option is useful
      when several sources send packets to the same destination address and
      port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and only
      one sender shall be accepted. To allow a more precise selection of the
      sender, use option --source. Options --first-source and --source are
      mutually exclusive.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ip-udp [address:]port
      The [address:]port describes the destination of UDP packets to receive.
      The 'port' part is mandatory and specifies the UDP port to listen on. The
      'address' part is optional. It specifies an IP multicast address to
      listen on. It can be also a host name that translates to a multicast
      address. An optional source address can be specified as 'source@address:
      port' in the case of SSM.

  --irdeto
      Interpret all EMM and ECM from unknown CAS as coming from Irdeto. By
      default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted according to the CA_descriptor
      which references their PID. This option is useful when analyzing partial
      transport streams without CAT or PMT to correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --local-address address
      Specify the IP address of the local interface on which to listen. It can
      be also a host name that translates to a local address. By default,
      listen on all local interfaces.

  -x value
  --max-tables value
      Maximum number of tables to dump. Stop logging tables when this limit is
      reached. Useful with --ip-udp which never ends otherwise.

  --mediaguard
      Interpret all EMM and ECM from unknown CAS as coming from MediaGuard. By
      default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted according to the CA_descriptor
      which references their PID. This option is useful when analyzing partial
      transport streams without CAT or PMT to correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --nagravision
      Interpret all EMM and ECM from unknown CAS as coming from NagraVision. By
      default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted according to the CA_descriptor
      which references their PID. This option is useful when analyzing partial
      transport streams without CAT or PMT to correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --nds
      Interpret all EMM and ECM from unknown CAS as coming from Synamedia
      (formerly known as NDS). By default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted
      according to the CA_descriptor which references their PID. This option is
      useful when analyzing partial transport streams without CAT or PMT to
      correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --nested-tlv[=min-size]
      With option --tlv, try to interpret the value field of each TLV record as
      another TLV area. If the min-size value is specified, the nested TLV
      interpretation is performed only on value fields larger than this size.
      The syntax of the nested TLV is the same as the enclosing TLV.

  --no-encapsulation
      With --ip-udp, receive the tables as raw binary messages in UDP packets.
      By default, the tables are formatted into TLV messages.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely
      necessary.

  -r
  --raw-dump
      Raw dump of section, no interpretation.

  --receive-timeout value
      Specify the UDP reception timeout in milliseconds. This timeout applies
      to each receive operation, individually. By default, receive operations
      wait for data, possibly forever.

  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the
      option is present for legacy only.

  --source address[:port]
      Filter UDP packets based on the specified source address. This option is
      useful when several sources send packets to the same destination address
      and port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and
      only one sender shall be accepted. Options --first-source and --source
      are mutually exclusive.

  --ssm
      Force the usage of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) using the source which
      is specified by the option --source. The --ssm option is implicit when
      the syntax 'source@address:port' is used.

  --tlv value
      For sections of unknown types, this option specifies how to interpret
      some parts of the section payload as TLV records. Several --tlv options
      are allowed, each one describes a part of the section payload.
      
      Each syntax string has the form "start,size,tagSize,lengthSize,order".
      The start and size fields define the offset and size of the TLV area in
      the section payload. If the size field is "auto", the TLV extends up to
      the end of the section. If the start field is "auto", the longest TLV
      area in the section payload will be used. The fields tagSize and
      lengthSize indicate the size in bytes of the Tag and Length fields in the
      TLV structure. The field order must be either "msb" or "lsb" and
      indicates the byte order of the Tag and Length fields.
      
      All fields are optional. The default values are "auto,auto,1,1,msb".

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.

  --viaccess
      Interpret all EMM and ECM from unknown CAS as coming from Viaccess. By
      default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted according to the CA_descriptor
      which references their PID. This option is useful when analyzing partial
      transport streams without CAT or PMT to correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --widevine
      Interpret all EMM and ECM from unknown CAS as coming from Widevine CAS.
      By default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted according to the
      CA_descriptor which references their PID. This option is useful when
      analyzing partial transport streams without CAT or PMT to correctly
      identify the CA PID's.
