Regulate the TS packets flow based on PCR or bitrate

Usage: tsp -P regulate [options]

Regulate (slow down only) the TS packets flow according to a specified
bitrate or based on PCR values from a reference PID. Useful to play a
non-regulated input (such as a TS file) to a non-regulated output device
such as IP multicast.

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specify the bitrate in b/s. By default, use the "input" bitrate,
      typically resulting from the PCR analysis of the input file.

  --help

  -p value
  --packet-burst value
      Number of packets to burst at a time. Does not modify the average
      output bitrate but influence smoothing and CPU load. The default
      is 16 packets.

  --pcr-synchronous
      Regulate the flow based on the Program Clock Reference from the transport
      stream. By default, use a bitrate, not PCR's.

  --pid-pcr value
      With --pcr-synchronous, specify the reference PID for PCR's. By default,
      use the first PID containing PCR's.

  --wait-min value
      With --pcr-synchronous, specify the minimum wait time in milli-seconds.
      The default is 50 ms.
