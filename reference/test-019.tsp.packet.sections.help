Remove or merge sections from various PID's

Usage: tsp -P sections [options]

Options:

  -e id1[-id2]
  --etid-remove id1[-id2]
      Remove all sections with the corresponding "extended table id" values.
      The value is a combination of the table id and the table id extension.
      For example, the option -e 0x4A1234 removes all BAT sections (table id
      0x4A) for bouquet id 0x1234 (table id extension). Several options
      --etid-remove can be specified.

  -n
  --null-pid-reuse
      With this option, null packets can be replaced by packets for the output
      PID. By default, only packets from input PID's are replaced by output
      packets. This option may need to be used when --stuffing is specified and
      the input PID's contained packed sections. In that case, the output
      payload can be larger than the input and additional packets must be used.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -o value
  --output-pid value
      Specifies the output PID. By default, the first input PID on the command
      line is used. If the output PID is different from all input PID's and
      this output PID already exists in the transport stream, an error is
      generated.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Specify input PID's. More than one input PID can be specified. All
      sections from all input PID's are merged into the output PID. At least
      one input PID must be specified.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Insert stuffing at end of each section, up to the next TS packet
      boundary. By default, sections are packed and start in the middle of a TS
      packet, after the previous section. Note, however, that section headers
      are never scattered over a packet boundary.

  -t id1[-id2]
  --tid-remove id1[-id2]
      Remove all sections with the corresponding table id. Several options
      --tid-remove can be specified.
