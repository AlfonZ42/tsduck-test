Analyze the structure of a transport stream

Usage: tsp -P analyze [options]

Options:

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting DVB strings without
      explicit character table code. According to DVB standard ETSI EN 300 468,
      the default DVB character set is ISO-6937. However, some bogus
      signalization may assume that the default character set is different,
      typically the usual local character table for the region. This option
      forces a non-standard character table. The available table names are
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --error-analysis
      Report analysis about detected errors.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --global-pid-list
      Report the list of all global PID's, that is to say PID's which are not
      referenced by a specific service but are or are referenced by the
      standard DVB PSI/SI. This include, for instance, PID's of the PAT, EMM's,
      EIT's, stuffing, etc.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --interval value
      Produce a new output file at regular intervals. The interval value is in
      seconds. After outputing a file, the analysis context is reset, ie. each
      output file contains a fully independent analysis.

  -m
  --multiple-files
      When used with --interval and --output-file, create a new file for each
      analysis instead of rewriting the previous file. Assuming that the
      specified output file name has the form 'base.ext', each file is created
      with a time stamp in its name as 'base_YYYYMMDD_hhmmss.ext'.

  --normalized
      Complete report about the transport stream, the services and the PID's in
      a normalized output format (useful for automatic analysis).

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specify the output text file for the analysis result. By default, use the
      standard output.

  --pes-pid-list
      Report the list of all PID's which are declared as carrying PES packets
      (audio, video, subtitles, etc).

  --pid-analysis
      Report analysis for each PID.

  --pid-list
      Report the list of all PID's.

  --prefix value
      For one-line displays (options --*-list), prepend the specified string to
      all values. For instance, options --global --prefix -p outputs something
      like '-p 0 -p 1 -p 16', which is an acceptable option list for the tsp
      filter plugin.

  --service-analysis
      Report analysis for each service.

  --service-list
      Report the list of all service ids.

  --service-pid-list value
      Report the list of all PID's which are referenced by the specified
      service id.

  --suspect-max-consecutive value
      Specifies the maximum number of consecutive "suspect" packets. The
      default value is 1. If set to zero, the suspect packet detection is
      disabled.
      
      Suspect packets are TS packets which are technically correct but which
      may be suspected of being incorrect, resulting in analysis errors.
      Typically, in the middle of a suite of packets with uncorrectable binary
      errors, one packet may appear to have no such error while it has some
      errors in fact. To avoid adding this type of packets in the analysis, a
      packet is declared as "suspect" (and consequently ignored in the
      analysis) when:
      - its PID is unknown (no other packet was found in this PID)
      - it immediately follows a certain amount of packet containing errors
      (see option --suspect-min-error-count)
      - it immediately follows no more than the specified number consecutive
      suspect packets.

  --suspect-min-error-count value
      Specifies the minimum number of consecutive packets with errors before
      starting "suspect" packet detection. See also option
      --suspect-max-consecutive. The default value is 1. If set to zero, the
      suspect packet detection is disabled.

  --table-analysis
      Report analysis for each table.

  --title value
      Display the specified string as title header.

  --ts-analysis
      Report global transport stream analysis.
      
      The output can include full synthetic analysis (options *-analysis),
      fully normalized output (option --normalized) or a simple list of values
      on one line (options --*-list). The second and third type of options are
      useful to write automated scripts.
      
      If output-control options are specified, only the selected outputs are
      produced. If no option is given, the default is: --ts-analysis
      --service-analysis --pid-analysis --table-analysis

  --unreferenced-pid-list
      Report the list of all unreferenced PID's, that is to say PID's which are
      neither referenced by a service nor known as or referenced by the
      standard DVB PSI/SI.

  -w
  --wide-display
      Use a wider grid display with more information on each line.
