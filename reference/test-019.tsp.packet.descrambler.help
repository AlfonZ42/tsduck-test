Generic DVB descrambler.

Usage: tsp -P descrambler [options] [service]

This plugin descrambles fixed PID's with fixed control words. As a demo, it can
also descramble services for which clear ECM's were generated using the utility
named tsecmg, a DVB SimulCrypt-compliant ECMG for test and demo.

Service:
  Specifies the optional service to descramble. If no fixed control word is
  specified, ECM's from the service are used to extract control words.

  If the argument is an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is
  interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name,
  as specified in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are
  ignored. If the input TS does not contain an SDT, use service ids only.

  If the argument is omitted, --pid options shall be specified to list explicit
  PID's to descramble and fixed control words shall be specified as well.

General options:

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Descramble packets with this PID value. Several -p or --pid options may be
      specified. By default, descramble the specified service.

  --synchronous
      Specify to synchronously decipher the ECM's. By default, continue
      processing packets while processing ECM's. Use this option with
      offline packet processing. Use the default (asynchronous) with live
      packet processing.

  --version
      Display the version number.

Transport stream scrambling options:

  --atis-idsa
      Use ATIS-IDSA descrambling (ATIS-0800006) instead of DVB-CSA2 (the
      default). The control words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.

  -c value
  --cw value
      Specifies a fixed and constant control word for all TS packets. The value
      must be a string of 16 hexadecimal digits (32 digits with --atis-idsa).

  -f name
  --cw-file name
      Specifies a text file containing the list of control words to apply.
      Each line of the file must contain exactly 16 hexadecimal digits (32
      digits with --atis-idsa). The next control word is used each time the
      "scrambling_control" changes in the TS packets header. When all control
      words are used, the first one is used again, and so on.

  -n
  --no-entropy-reduction
      With DVB-CSA2, do not perform control word entropy reduction to 48 bits.
      Keep full 64-bit control words. Ignored with --atis-idsa.
