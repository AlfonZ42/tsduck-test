Analyze the structure of a transport stream

Usage: tsanalyze [options] [filename]

Parameter:

  Input MPEG capture file (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate of the transport stream in bits/second (based on
      188-byte packets). By default, the bitrate is evaluated using the PCR in
      the transport stream.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --error-analysis
      Report analysis about detected errors.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --global-pid-list
      Report the list of all global PID's, that is to say PID's which are not
      referenced by a specific service but are or are referenced by the
      standard DVB PSI/SI. This include, for instance, PID's of the PAT, EMM's,
      EIT's, stuffing, etc.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on Japanese transport streams.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  --normalized
      Complete report about the transport stream, the services and the PID's in
      a normalized output format (useful for automatic analysis).

  --pes-pid-list
      Report the list of all PID's which are declared as carrying PES packets
      (audio, video, subtitles, etc).

  --pid-analysis
      Report analysis for each PID.

  --pid-list
      Report the list of all PID's.

  --prefix value
      For one-line displays (options --*-list), prepend the specified string to
      all values. For instance, options --global --prefix -p outputs something
      like '-p 0 -p 1 -p 16', which is an acceptable option list for the tsp
      filter plugin.

  --service-analysis
      Report analysis for each service.

  --service-list
      Report the list of all service ids.

  --service-pid-list value
      Report the list of all PID's which are referenced by the specified
      service id.

  --suspect-max-consecutive value
      Specifies the maximum number of consecutive "suspect" packets. The
      default value is 1. If set to zero, the suspect packet detection is
      disabled.
      
      Suspect packets are TS packets which are technically correct but which
      may be suspected of being incorrect, resulting in analysis errors.
      Typically, in the middle of a suite of packets with uncorrectable binary
      errors, one packet may appear to have no such error while it has some
      errors in fact. To avoid adding this type of packets in the analysis, a
      packet is declared as "suspect" (and consequently ignored in the
      analysis) when:
      - its PID is unknown (no other packet was found in this PID)
      - it immediately follows a certain amount of packet containing errors
      (see option --suspect-min-error-count)
      - it immediately follows no more than the specified number consecutive
      suspect packets.

  --suspect-min-error-count value
      Specifies the minimum number of consecutive packets with errors before
      starting "suspect" packet detection. See also option
      --suspect-max-consecutive. The default value is 1. If set to zero, the
      suspect packet detection is disabled.

  --table-analysis
      Report analysis for each table.

  --title value
      Display the specified string as title header.

  --ts-analysis
      Report global transport stream analysis.
      
      The output can include full synthetic analysis (options *-analysis),
      fully normalized output (option --normalized) or a simple list of values
      on one line (options --*-list). The second and third type of options are
      useful to write automated scripts.
      
      If output-control options are specified, only the selected outputs are
      produced. If no option is given, the default is: --ts-analysis
      --service-analysis --pid-analysis --table-analysis

  --unreferenced-pid-list
      Report the list of all unreferenced PID's, that is to say PID's which are
      neither referenced by a service nor known as or referenced by the
      standard DVB PSI/SI.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.

  -w
  --wide-display
      Use a wider grid display with more information on each line.
