Monitor SCTE 35 splice information

Usage: tsp -P splicemonitor [options]

Options:

  -a
  --all-commands
      Same as --display-commands but display all SCTE-35 splice information
      commands. By default, only display splice insert commands.

  -d
  --display-commands
      Display the content of SCTE-35 splice insert commands. By default, only
      log a short event description.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -n
  --no-adjustment
      When computing the anticipated pre-roll time at reception of a splice
      command, do not try to adjust the time using the distance between the
      last PTS and the splice command. By default, use the bitrate to adjust
      the supposed PTS of the splice command itself.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -o file-name
  --output-file file-name
      Specify an output text file. By default, use the message logging system
      (or standard output with --display-commands).

  -i
  --packet-index
      Display the current TS packet index for each message or event.

  -s value
  --splice-pid value
      Specify one PID carrying SCTE-35 sections to monitor. By default, all
      SCTE-35 PID's are monitored.

  -t value
  --time-pid value
      Specify one video or audio PID containing PTS time stamps to link with
      SCTE-35 sections to monitor. By default, the PMT's are used to link
      between PTS PID's and SCTE-35 PID's.
