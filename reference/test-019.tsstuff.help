Add stuffing to a TS file to reach a target bitrate.

Usage: tsstuff [options] [input-file]

Input file:
  The input file is a TS file, typically with variable bitrate content.
  By default, the standard input is used.

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Target constant bitrate of the output file. This is mandatory parameter,
      there is no default.

  --buffer-size value
      Input buffer size, in bytes. Must be large enough to always contain two
      time stamps in the reference PID. Default: 4,194,304 bytes.

  -d
  --dts-based
      Use Decoding Time Stamps (DTS) in the reference PID to evaluate the
      amount of stuffing to insert. The default is to use Program Clock
      References (PCR) instead of DTS.

  -f value
  --final-inter-packet value
      Number of stuffing packets to add between input packets after the last
      time stamp (PCR or DTS). By default, use the same number as in the
      previous segment, between the last two time stamps.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --initial-inter-packet value
      Number of stuffing packets to add between input packets before the first
      time stamp (PCR or DTS). By default, use the same number as in the
      first segment, between the first two time stamps.

  -l value
  --leading-packets value
      Number of consecutive stuffing packets to add at the beginning of the
      output file, before the first input packet. The default is zero.

  -o filename
  --output filename
      Output file name (standard output by default). The output file is a TS
      file with the same packets as the input file with interspersed stuffing
      packets and a constant bitrate.

  -r value
  --reference-pid value
      PID in which to collect time stamps (PCR or DTS) to use as reference
      for the insertion of stuffing packets. By default, use the first PID
      containing the specified type of time stamps (PCR or DTS).

  -t value
  --trailing-packets value
      Number of consecutive stuffing packets to add at the end of the
      output file, after the last input packet. The default is zero.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the version number.
