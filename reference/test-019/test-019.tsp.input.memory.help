Direct memory input from an application

Usage: tsp -I memory [options]

Developer plugin: This plugin is useful only to C++, Java or Python developers
who run a TSProcessor pipeline inside their applications and want this
application to directly interact with the input of the pipeline.

Options:

  -e value
  --event-code value
      Signal a plugin event with the specified code each time the plugin needs
      input packets. The event data is an instance of PluginEventData pointing
      to the input buffer. The application shall handle the event, waiting for
      input packets as long as necessary. Returning zero packet (or not
      handling the event) means end if input.
