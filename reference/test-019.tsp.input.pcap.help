Read TS packets from a pcap or pcap-ng file

Usage: tsp -I pcap [options] [file-name]

Parameter:

  The name of a '.pcap' or '.pcapng' capture file as produced by Wireshark for
  instance. This input plugin extracts IPv4 UDP datagrams which contain
  transport stream packets. Use the standard input by default, when no file
  name is specified.

Options:

  -d [address][:port]
  --destination [address][:port]
      Filter UDP datagrams based on the specified destination socket address.
      By default or if either the IP address or UDP port is missing, use the
      destination of the first matching UDP datagram containing TS packets.
      Then, select only UDP datagrams with this socket address.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -m
  --multicast-only
      When there is no --destination option, select the first multicast address
      which is found in a UDP datagram. By default, use the destination address
      of the first UDP datagram containing TS packets, unicast or multicast.

  -s [address][:port]
  --source [address][:port]
      Filter UDP datagrams based on the specified source socket address. By
      default, do not filter on source address.

  --timestamp-priority name
      Specify how the input time-stamp of each packet is computed. The name
      specifies an ordered list. The first available time-stamp value is used
      as input time-stamp. The possible time-stamp sources are:
      - rtp : The RTP time stamp, when the UDP packet is an RTP packet.
      - pcap : pcap capture time stamp.
      - tsp : A software time-stamp, provided by tsp when the input plugin
      returns a chunk of packets.
      The tsp-provided time-stamp is always available, always comes last and is
      less precise. The default is rtp-pcap-tsp.
      Must be one of "pcap-rtp-tsp", "pcap-tsp", "rtp-pcap-tsp", "rtp-tsp",
      "tsp".
