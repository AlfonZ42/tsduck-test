Generic DVB descrambler

Usage: tsp -P descrambler [options] [service]

Parameter:

  Specifies the optional service to descramble. If no fixed control word is
  specified, ECM's from the service are used to extract control words.
  
  If the argument is an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is
  interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name,
  as specified in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are
  ignored. If the input TS does not contain an SDT, use service ids only.
  
  If the argument is omitted, --pid options shall be specified to list explicit
  PID's to descramble and fixed control words shall be specified as well.

Options:

  --atis-idsa
      Use ATIS-IDSA scrambling (ATIS-0800006) instead of DVB-CSA2 (the
      default). The control words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.

  --cas-id value
      Specify the CA_system_id to filter when searching for ECM streams. Since
      this descrambler is a demo tool using clear ECM's, it is unlikely that
      other real ECM streams exist. So, by default, any ECM stream is used to
      get the clear ECM's.
      
      This plugin descrambles fixed PID's with fixed control words. As a demo,
      it can also descramble services for which clear ECM's were generated
      using the utility named tsecmg, a DVB SimulCrypt-compliant ECMG for test
      and demo.

  -c value
  --cw value
      Specifies a fixed and constant control word for all TS packets. The value
      must be a string of 16 hexadecimal digits (32 digits with --atis-idsa).

  -f name
  --cw-file name
      Specifies a text file containing the list of control words to apply. Each
      line of the file must contain exactly 16 hexadecimal digits (32 digits
      with --atis-idsa or --dvb-cissa). The next control word is used each time
      the "scrambling_control" changes in the TS packets header. When all
      control words are used, the first one is used again, and so on.

  --dvb-cissa
      Use DVB-CISSA scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2 (the default). The control
      words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.

  --dvb-csa2
      Use DVB-CSA2 scrambling. This is the default.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -n
  --no-entropy-reduction
      With DVB-CSA2, do not perform control word entropy reduction to 48 bits.
      Keep full 64-bit control words. Ignored with --atis-idsa or --dvb-cissa.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Descramble packets with this PID value or range of PID values. Several -p
      or --pid options may be specified. By default, descramble the specified
      service.

  --synchronous
      Specify to synchronously decipher the ECM's. By default, in real-time
      mode, the packet processing continues while processing ECM's. This option
      is always on in offline mode.
