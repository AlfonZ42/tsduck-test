Zap on one service: Produce an SPTS containing only the specified service

Usage: tsp -P zap [options] service

Parameter:

  Specifies the service to keep. If the argument is an integer value (either
  decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is
  interpreted as a service name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case
  sensitive and blanks are ignored. If the input TS does not contain an SDT,
  use a service id.

Options:

  -a value
  --audio value
      Remove all audio components except the specified one. The name is a
      three-letters language code. By default, keep all audio components. This
      option and the --audio-pid option are mutually exclusive.

  --audio-pid value
      Remove all audio components except the specified audio PID. By default,
      keep all audio components. This option and the --audio option are
      mutually exclusive.

  -c
  --cas
      Keep Conditional Access System sections (CAT and EMM's). Remove them by
      default. Note that the ECM's for the specified service are always kept.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --eit
      Keep EIT sections for the specified service. EIT sections for other
      services are removed. By default, all EIT's are removed.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --ignore-absent
      Do not stop if the service does not exist or disappears. Continue to pass
      an empty stream until the service appears or re-appears.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  -e
  --no-ecm
      Remove all ECM PID's. By default, keep all ECM PID's.

  -n
  --no-subtitles
      Remove all subtitles. By default, keep all subtitles.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -p
  --pes-only
      Keep only the PES elementary streams (audio, video, subtitles). Remove
      all PSI/SI and CAS information.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Replace excluded packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing
      them. Useful to preserve bitrate.

  -t value
  --subtitles value
      Remove all subtitles except the specified one. The name is a
      three-letters language code. By default, keep all subtitles.

  --subtitles-pid value
      Remove all subtitles except the specified PID. By default, keep all
      subtitles. This option and the --subtitles option are mutually exclusive.
