Analyze the NIT and output a list of tuning information

Usage: tsp -P nitscan [options]

Options:

  -a
  --all-nits
      Analyze all NIT's (NIT actual and NIT other). By default, only the NIT
      actual is analyzed.

  -c[prefix]
  --comment[=prefix]
      Add a comment line before each tuning information. The optional prefix
      designates the comment prefix. If the option --comment is present but the
      prefix is omitted, the default prefix is "# ".

  -d
  --dvb-options
      The characteristics of each transponder are formatted as a list of
      command-line options for the tsp plugin "dvb" such as --frequency,
      --symbol-rate, etc. By default, the tuning information are formatted as
      Linux DVB "zap" configuration files as used by the standard utilities
      "szap", "czap" and "tzap".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specify the output text file for the analysis result. By default, use the
      standard output.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the PID on which the NIT is expected. By default, the PAT is
      analyzed to get the PID of the NIT. DVB-compliant networks should use PID
      16 (0x0010) for the NIT and signal it in the PAT.

  -t
  --terminate
      Stop the packet transmission after the first NIT is analyzed. Should be
      specified when tsp is used only to scan the NIT.

  -v[prefix]
  --variable[=prefix]
      Each tuning information line is output as a shell environment variable
      definition. The name of each variable is built from a prefix and the TS
      id. The default prefix is "TS" and can be changed through the optional
      value of the option --variable.
