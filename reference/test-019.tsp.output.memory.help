Direct memory output to an application

Usage: tsp -O memory [options]

Developer plugin: This plugin is useful only to C++, Java or Python developers
who run a TSProcessor pipeline inside their applications and want this
application to directly interact with the output of the pipeline.

  -p value
  --port value
      A 'port number' for the memory communication with the application. If
      there is only one instance of TSProcessor running in the application, the
      default value (zero) is just fine.
