Fix continuity counters in a transport stream

Usage: tsfixcc [options] filename

Parameter:

  MPEG capture file to be modified.

Options:

  -c
  --circular
      Enforce continuity when the file is played repeatedly. Add empty packets,
      if necessary, on each PID so that the continuity is preserved between end
      and beginning of file.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -n
  --noaction
      Display what should be performed but do not modify the file.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.
