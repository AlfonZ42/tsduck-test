Merge TS packets coming from the standard output of a command

Usage: tsp -P merge [options] 'command'

Parameter:

  Specifies the command line to execute in the created process.

Options:

  -d pid[-pid]
  --drop pid[-pid]
      Drop the specified PID or range of PID's from the merged stream. By
      default, the PID's 0x00 to 0x1F are dropped and all other PID's are
      passed. This can be modified using options --drop and --pass. Several
      options --drop can be specified.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-conflicts
      Ignore PID conflicts. By default, when packets with the same PID are
      present in the two streams, the PID is dropped from the merged stream.
      Warning: this is a dangerous option which can result in an inconsistent
      transport stream.

  -j
  --joint-termination
      Perform a "joint termination" when the merged stream is terminated. See
      "tsp --help" for more details on "joint termination".

  --max-queue value
      Specify the maximum number of queued TS packets before their insertion
      into the stream. The default is 1,000.

  --no-pcr-restamp
      Do not restamp PCR's from the merged TS into the main TS. By default,
      PCR's in the merged stream are restamped to match their position in the
      final stream. The DTS and PTS are never restamped because they are
      independent from their position in the stream. When the PCR's in the
      merged stream have discontinuities (such as when cycling a TS file),
      restamping the PCR's can break the video playout since they become
      decorrelated with the DTS and PTS.

  --no-psi-merge
      Do not merge PSI/SI from the merged TS into the main TS. By default, the
      PAT, CAT and SDT are merged so that the services from the merged stream
      are properly referenced and PID's 0x00 to 0x1F are dropped from the
      merged stream.

  --no-wait
      Do not wait for child process termination at end of processing.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -p pid[-pid]
  --pass pid[-pid]
      Pass the specified PID or range of PID's from the merged stream. By
      default, the PID's 0x00 to 0x1F are dropped and all other PID's are
      passed. This can be modified using options --drop and --pass. Several
      options --pass can be specified.

  --reset-label label1[-label2]
      Clear the specified labels on the merged packets. Apply to original
      packets from the merged stream only, not to updated PSI. Several
      --reset-label options may be specified.

  --set-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on the merged packets. Apply to original packets
      from the merged stream only, not to updated PSI. Several --set-label
      options may be specified.

  --terminate
      Terminate packet processing when the merged stream is terminated. By
      default, when packet insertion is complete, the transmission continues
      and the stuffing is no longer modified.

  -t
  --transparent
      Pass all PID's without logical transformation. Equivalent to
      --no-psi-merge --ignore-conflicts --pass 0x00-0x1F.
