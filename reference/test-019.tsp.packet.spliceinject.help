Inject SCTE 35 splice commands in a transport stream

Usage: tsp -P spliceinject [options]

The splice commands are injected as splice information sections, as defined by
the SCTE 35 standard. All forms of splice information sections can be injected.
The sections shall be provided by some external equipment, in real time. The
format of the section can be binary or XML. There are two possible mechanisms
to provide the sections: files or UDP.

Files shall be specified as one single specification with optional wildcards.
Example: --files '/path/to/dir/*'. All files which are copied or updated into
this directory are automatically loaded and injected. It is possible to auto-
matically delete all files after being loaded.

UDP datagrams shall contain exactly one XML document or binary sections. The
sections are injected upon reception.

General options:

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --inject-count value
      For non-immediate splice_insert() commands, specifies the number of times
      the same splice information section is injected. The default is 2.
      Other splice commands are injected once only.

  --inject-interval value
      For non-immediate splice_insert() commands, specifies the interval in
      milliseconds between two insertions of the same splice information
      section. The default is 800 ms.

  --pcr-pid value
      Specifies the PID carrying PCR reference clock. By default, use the PCR
      PID as declared in the PMT of the service.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specifies the PID for the injection of the splice information tables. By
      default, the injection of splice commands is done in the component of the
      service with a stream type equal to 0x86 in the PMT, as specified by SCTE
      35 standard.

  --pts-pid value
      Specifies the PID carrying PTS reference clock. By default, use the video
      PID as declared in the PMT of the service.

  --queue-size value
      Specifies the maximum number of sections in the internal queue, sections
      which are received from files or UDP but not yet inserted into the TS.
      The default is 100.

  -s value
  --service value
      Specifies the service for the insertion of the splice information tables.
      If the argument is an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is
      interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service
      name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks
      are ignored. If no service is specified, the options --pid and --pts-pid
      must be specified (--pcr-pid is optional).

  --start-delay value
      For non-immediate splice_insert() commands, start to insert the first
      section this number of milliseconds before the specified splice PTS
      value. The default is 2,000 ms.

File input options:

  -d
  --delete-files
      Specifies that the files should be deleted after being loaded. By default,
      the files are left unmodified after being loaded. When a loaded file is
      modified later, it is reloaded and re-injected.

  -f 'file-wildcard'
  --files 'file-wildcard'
      A file specification with optional wildcards indicating which files should
      be polled. When such a file is created or updated, it is loaded and its
      content is interpreted as binary or XML tables. All tables shall be splice
      information tables.

  --max-file-size value
      Files larger than the specified size are ignored. This avoids loading
      large spurious files which could clutter memory. The default is 2,048
      bytes.

  --min-stable-delay value
      A file size needs to be stable during that duration, in milliseconds, for
      the file to be reported as added or modified. This prevents too frequent
      poll notifications when a file is being written and his size modified at
      each poll. The default is 500 ms.

  --poll-interval value
      Specifies the interval in milliseconds between two poll operations. The
      default is 500 ms.

UDP input options:

  --buffer-size value
      Specifies the UDP socket receive buffer size (socket option).

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely necessary.

  -r
  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the option
      is present for legacy only.

  -u [address:]port
  --udp [address:]port
      Specifies the local UDP port on which the plugin listens for incoming
      binary or XML splice information tables. When present, the optional
      address shall specify a local IP address or host name (by default, the
      plugin accepts connections on any local IP interface).
