Extract Teletext subtitles in SRT format.

Usage: tsp -P teletext [options]

Options:

  -c
  --colors
      Add font color tags in the subtitles. By default, no color is specified.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -l name
  --language name
      Specifies the language of the subtitles to select. This option is useful
      only with --service, when the PMT of the service declares Teletext
      subtitles in different languages.

  -m value
  --max-frames value
      Specifies the maximum number of Teletext frames to extract. The processing
      is then stopped. By default, all frames are extracted.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specifies the SRT output file name. This is a text file. By default, the
      SRT subtitles are displayed on the standard output.

  --page value
      Specifies the Teletext page to extract. This option is useful only when
      the Teletext PID contains several pages. By default, the first Teletext
      frame defines the page to use.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specifies the PID carrying Teletext subtitles. Alternatively, if the
      Teletext PID is properly signalled in the PMT of its service, the option
      --service can be used instead.

  -s value
  --service value
      Specifies the service with Teletext subtitles. If the argument is an
      integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a
      service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name, as specified
      in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are ignored.
      The first teletext_descriptor in the PMT of the service is used to
      identify the PID carrying Teletext subtitles. If neither --service nor
      --pid is specified, the first service in the PAT is used.

  --version
      Display the version number.
