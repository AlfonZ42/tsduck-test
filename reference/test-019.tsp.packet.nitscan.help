Analyze the NIT and output a list of tuning information

Usage: tsp -P nitscan [options]

Options:

  -a
  --all-nits
      Analyze all NIT's (NIT actual and NIT other). By default, only the NIT
      actual is analyzed.

  -c[prefix]
  --comment[=prefix]
      Add a comment line before each tuning information. The optional prefix
      designates the comment prefix. If the option --comment is present but the
      prefix is omitted, the default prefix is "# ".

  -d
  --dvb-options
      The characteristics of each transponder are formatted as a list of
      command-line options for the tsp plugin "dvb" such as --frequency,
      --symbol-rate, etc. This is the default when no --save-channels or
      --update-channels is specified.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -n value
  --network-id value
      Specify the network-id of a NIT other to analyze instead of the NIT
      actual. By default, the NIT actual is analyzed.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specify the output text file for the analysis result. By default, use the
      standard output.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the PID on which the NIT is expected. By default, the PAT is
      analyzed to get the PID of the NIT. DVB-compliant networks should use PID
      16 (0x0010) for the NIT and signal it in the PAT.

  --save-channels filename
      Save the description of all transport streams in the specified XML file.
      If the file name is "-", use the default tuning configuration file. See
      also option --update-channels.

  -t
  --terminate
      Stop the packet transmission after the first NIT is analyzed. Should be
      specified when tsp is used only to scan the NIT.

  --update-channels filename
      Update the description of all transport streams in the specified XML
      file. The content of each transport stream is preserved, only the tuning
      information is updated. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the
      file name is "-", use the default tuning configuration file. See also
      option --save-channels.

  -v[prefix]
  --variable[=prefix]
      Each tuning information line is output as a shell environment variable
      definition. The name of each variable is built from a prefix and the TS
      id. The default prefix is "TS" and can be changed through the optional
      value of the option --variable.
