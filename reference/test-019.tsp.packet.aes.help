Experimental AES scrambling of TS packets

Usage: tsp -P aes [options] [service]

Parameter:

  Specifies the service to scramble. If the argument is an integer value
  (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a service id.
  Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name, as specified in the SDT. The
  name is not case sensitive and blanks are ignored. If the service is
  unspecified, individual PID's are scrambled (see option --pid).

Options:

  --cbc
      Use Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode without padding. The residue (last
      part of the packet payload, shorter than 16 bytes) is left clear.

  --cts1
      Use Cipher Text Stealing (CTS) mode, as defined by Bruce Schneier in its
      "Applied Cryptography" and by RFC 2040 as RC5-CTS. TS packets with a
      payload shorter than 17 bytes are left clear.

  --cts2
      Use Cipher Text Stealing (CTS) mode as defined in NIST's proposal. TS
      packets with a payload shorter than 16 bytes are left clear.

  --cts3
      Use ECB Cipher Text Stealing (ECB-CTS) mode, as defined by Wikipedia. TS
      packets with a payload shorter than 17 bytes are left clear.

  --cts4
      Use (weird) ECB Cipher Text Stealing (ECB-CTS) mode, as implemented in ST
      71xx chips. TS packets with a payload shorter than 17 bytes are left
      clear.

  -d
  --descramble
      Descramble instead of scramble.

  --dvs042
      Use DVS 042 (now ANSI/SCTE 52 2003) cipher block chaining mode. TS
      packets with a payload shorter than 16 bytes are left clear.

  --ecb
      Use Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode without padding. The residue (last
      part of the packet payload, shorter than 16 bytes) is left clear. This is
      the default mode.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --iv value
      Specifies the initialization vector. Must be a string of 32 hexadecimal
      digits. Must not be used in ECB mode. The default IV is all zeroes.

  -k value
  --key value
      Specifies a fixed and constant AES key for all TS packets. The value must
      be a string of 32 or 64 hexadecimal digits. This is a mandatory
      parameter.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Specifies a PID to scramble. Can be used instead of specifying a service.
      Several -p or --pid options may be specified.
