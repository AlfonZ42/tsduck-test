Insert TS packets in a transport stream

Usage: tsp -P mux [options] input-file

Input file:

  Binary file containing 188-byte transport packets.

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate for the inserted packets, in bits/second.
      By default, all stuffing packets are replaced which means that
      the bitrate is neither constant nor guaranteed.

  --byte-offset value
      Start reading the file at the specified byte offset (default: 0).
      This option is allowed only if the input file is a regular file.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --inter-packet value
      Specifies the packet interval for the inserted packets, that is to say
      the number of TS packets in the transport between two new packets.
      Use instead of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be
      determined.

  --inter-time value
      Specifies the time interval for the inserted packets, that is to say the
      difference between the nearest PCR clock value at the point of insertion
      in milliseconds. Example: 1000 will keep roughly 1 second space between
      two inserted packets. The default is 0, it means inter-time is disabled.
      Use --pts-pid to specify the PID carrying the PCR clock of interest.

  -j
  --joint-termination
      Perform a "joint termination" when file insersion is complete.
      See "tsp --help" for more details on "joint termination".

  --max-insert-count value
      Stop inserting packets after this number of packets was inserted.

  --max-pts value
      Stop inserting packets when this PTS time has passed in the --pts-pid.

  --min-pts value
      Start inserting packets when this PTS time has passed in the --pts-pid.

  --no-continuity-update
      Do not update continuity counters in the inserted packets. By default,
      the continuity counters are updated in each inserted PID to preserve the
      continuity.

  --no-pid-conflict-check
      Do not check PID conflicts between the TS and the new inserted packets.
      By default, the processing is aborted if packets from the same PID are
      found both in the TS and the inserted packets.

  --packet-offset value
      Start reading the file at the specified TS packet (default: 0).
      This option is allowed only if the input file is a regular file.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Force the PID value of all inserted packets.

  --pts-pid value
      Defines the PID carrying PCR or PTS values for --min-pts and --max-pts.
      When no PTS values are found, PCR are used. PCR values are divided by 300,
      the system clock sub-factor, to get the corresponding PTS values.

  -r count
  --repeat count
      Repeat the playout of the file the specified number of times. By default,
      the file is infinitely repeated. This option is allowed only if the
      input file is a regular file.

  -t
  --terminate
      Terminate packet processing when file insersion is complete. By default,
      when packet insertion is complete, the transmission continues and the
      stuffing is no longer modified.
