Schedule packets pass or drop, based on time

Usage: tsp -P time [options]

Options:

  -d time
  --drop time
      All packets are dropped after the specified time.
      Several --drop options may be specified

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -n time
  --null time
      All packets are replaced by null packets after the specified time.
      Several --null options may be specified

  -p time
  --pass time
      All packets are passed unmodified after the specified time.
      Several --pass options may be specified

  -s time
  --stop time
      Packet transmission stops after the specified time and tsp terminates.

  -r
  --relative
      All time values are interpreted as a number of seconds relative to the
      tsp start time. By default, all time values are interpreted as an
      absolute time in the format "year/month/day:hour:minute:second".
      Option --relative is incompatible with --tdt or --utc.

  -t
  --tdt
      Use the Time & Date Table (TDT) from the transport stream as time
      reference instead of the system clock. Since the TDT contains UTC
      time, all time values in the command line must be UTC also.

  -u
  --utc
      Specifies that all time values in the command line are in UTC.
      By default, the time values are interpreted as system local time.

  --version
      Display the version number.

Specifying time values:

  A time value must be in the format "year/month/day:hour:minute:second"
  (unless --relative is specified, in which case it is a number of seconds).
  An empty value ("") means "from the beginning", that is to say when
  tsp starts. By default, packets are passed when tsp starts.
