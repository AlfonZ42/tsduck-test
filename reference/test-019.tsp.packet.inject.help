Inject tables and sections in a TS

Usage: tsp -P inject [options] input-file[=rate] ...

Parameters:

  Binary or XML files containing one or more sections or tables. By default,
  files ending in .xml are XML and files ending in .bin are binary. For other
  file names, explicitly specify --binary or --xml.

  If different repetition rates are required for different files, a parameter
  can be "filename=value" where value is the repetition rate in milliseconds
  for all sections in that file.

Options:

  --binary
      Specify that all input files are binary, regardless of their file name.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate for the new PID, in bits/second.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  -e value
  --evaluate-interval value
      When used with --replace and when specific repetition rates are specified
      for some input files, the bitrate of the target PID is re-evaluated on a
      regular basis. The value of this option specifies the number of packet in
      the target PID before re-evaluating its bitrate. The default is 100
      packets.

  -f
  --force-crc
      Force recomputation of CRC32 in long sections. Ignore CRC32 values in
      input file.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --inter-packet value
      Specifies the packet interval for the new PID, that is to say the number
      of TS packets in the transport between two packets of the new PID. Use
      instead of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be
      determined.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  -j
  --joint-termination
      Perform a "joint termination" when section insersion is complete.
      Meaningful only when --repeat is specified. See "tsp --help" for more
      details on "joint termination".

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --pid value
      PID of the output TS packets. This is a required parameter, there is no
      default value. To replace the content of an existing PID, use option
      --replace. To steal stuffing packets and create a new PID, use either
      option --bitrate or --inter-packet. Exactly one option --replace,
      --bitrate or --inter-packet must be specified.

  --poll-files
      Poll the presence and modification date of the input files. When a file
      is created, modified or deleted, reload all files at the next section
      boundary. When a file is deleted, its sections are no longer injected. By
      default, all input files are loaded once at initialization time and an
      error is generated if a file is missing.

  --repeat value
      Repeat the insertion of a complete cycle of sections the specified number
      of times. By default, the sections are infinitely repeated.

  -r
  --replace
      Replace the content of an existing PID. Do not steal stuffing.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Insert stuffing at end of each section, up to the next TS packet
      boundary. By default, sections are packed and start in the middle of a TS
      packet, after the previous section. Note, however, that section headers
      are never scattered over a packet boundary.

  -t
  --terminate
      Terminate packet processing when section insersion is complete.
      Meaningful only when --repeat is specified. By default, when section
      insertion is complete, the transmission continues and the stuffing is no
      longer modified (if --replace is specified, the PID is then replaced by
      stuffing).

  --xml
      Specify that all input files are XML, regardless of their file name.
