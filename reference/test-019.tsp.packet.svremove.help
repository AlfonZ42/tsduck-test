Remove a service

Usage: tsp -P svremove [options] service

Parameter:

  Specifies the service to remove. If the argument is an integer value (either
  decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is
  interpreted as a service name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case
  sensitive and blanks are ignored.

Options:

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -a
  --ignore-absent
      Ignore service if not present in the transport stream. By default, tsp
      fails if the service is not found.

  -b
  --ignore-bat
      Do not modify the BAT.

  -e
  --ignore-eit
      Do not modify the EIT's.

  -n
  --ignore-nit
      Do not modify the NIT.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Replace excluded packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing
      them. Useful to preserve bitrate.
