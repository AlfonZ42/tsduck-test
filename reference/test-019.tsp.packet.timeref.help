Update TDT and TOT with a new time reference

Usage: tsp -P timeref [options]

Options:

  -a value
  --add value
      Add the specified number of seconds to all UTC time. Specify a negative
      value to make the time reference go backward.

  --eit
      Update events start time in EIT's. By default, EIT's are not modified.
      When --add is used, the specified offset is applied to all events start
      time. When --start is used, EIT's are dropped until the first TDT or TOT
      is encountered. Then, the difference between the first TDT or TOT time
      and the new time reference at this point is applied.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --notdt
      Do not update TDT.

  --notot
      Do not update TOT.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -s value
  --start value
      Specify a new UTC date & time reference for the first packet in the
      stream. Then, the time reference is updated according to the number of
      packets and the bitrate. The time value can be in the format
      "year/month/day:hour:minute:second", or use the predefined name "system"
      for getting current time from the system clock.
