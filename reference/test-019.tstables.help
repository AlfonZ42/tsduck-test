MPEG Transport Stream PSI/SI Tables Collector.

Usage: tstables [options] [filename]

Input file:

  MPEG capture file (standard input if omitted).

Tables and sections logging options:

  By default, the tables are interpreted and formatted as text on the standard
  output. Several destinations can be specified at the same time: human-readable
  text output, binary output, UDP/IP messages.

  --all-once
      Same as --all-sections but collect each section only once per combination of
      PID, table id, table id extension, section number and version.

  -a
  --all-sections
      Display/save all sections, as they appear in the stream. By default,
      collect complete tables, with all sections of the tables grouped and
      ordered and collect each version of a table only once. Note that this
      mode is incompatible with --xml-output since valid XML structures may
      contain complete tables only.

  -b filename
  --binary-output filename
      Save sections in the specified binary output file.
      See also option -m, --multiple-files.

  -d
  --diversified-payload
      Select only sections with "diversified" payload. This means that
      section payloads containing the same byte value (all 0x00 or all 0xFF
      for instance) are ignored. Typically, such sections are stuffing and
      can be ignored that way.

  -f
  --flush
      Flush output after each display.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i address:port
  --ip-udp address:port
      Send binary tables over UDP/IP to the specified destination.
      The 'address' specifies an IP address which can be either unicast
      or multicast. It can be also a host name that translates to an IP
      address. The 'port' specifies the destination UDP port.

  --local-udp address
      With --ip-udp, when the destination is a multicast address, specify
      the IP address of the outgoing local interface. It can be also a host
      name that translates to a local address.

  --log
      Short one-line log of each table instead of full table display.

  --log-size value
      With option --log, specify how many bytes are displayed at the
      beginning of the table payload (the header is not displayed).
      The default is 8 bytes.

  -x value
  --max-tables value
      Maximum number of tables to dump. Stop logging tables when this
      limit is reached.

  -m
  --multiple-files
      Create multiple binary output files, one per section. A binary
      output file name must be specified (option -b or --binary-output).
      Assuming that the specified file name has the form 'base.ext',
      each file is created with the name 'base_pXXXX_tXX.ext' for
      short sections and 'base_pXXXX_tXX_eXXXX_vXX_sXX.ext' for long
      sections, where the XX specify the hexadecimal values of the
      PID, TID (table id), TIDext (table id extension), version and
      section index.

  --negate-pid
      Negate the PID filter: specified PID's are excluded.
      Warning: this can be a dangerous option on complete transport
      streams since PID's not containing sections can be accidentally
      selected.

  -n
  --negate-tid
      Negate the TID filter: specified TID's are excluded.

  --negate-tid-ext
      Negate the TID extension filter: specified TID extensions are
      excluded.

  --no-duplicate
      Do not report consecutive identical tables with a short section in the
      same PID. This can be useful for ECM's. This is the way to display new
      ECM's only. By default, tables with long sections are reported only when
      a new version is detected but tables with a short section are all reported.

  --no-encapsulation
      With --ip-udp, send the tables as raw binary messages in UDP packets.
      By default, the tables are formatted into TLV messages.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
  --text-output filename
      Save the tables or sections in human-readable text format in the specified
      file. By default, when no output option is specified, text is produced on
      the standard output. If you need text formatting on the standard output in
      addition to other output like binary files or UPD/IP, explicitly specify
      this option with "-" as output file name.

  --pack-all-sections
      Same as --all-sections but also modify each long section so that it becomes a
      valid complete table. Its section_number and last_section_number are forced
      to zero. Use with care because this may create inconsistent tables. This
      option can be useful with tables with sparse sections such as EIT's to save
      them in XML format.

  --pack-and-flush
      Before exiting, pack incomplete tables, ignoring missing sections, and flush
      them. Use with care because this may create inconsistent tables. Unlike option
      --pack-all-sections, --pack-and-flush does not force --all-sections because it
      only applies to the last incomplete tables before exiting.

  --packet-index
      Display the index of the first and last TS packet of each displayed
      section or table.

  -p value
  --pid value
      PID filter: select packets with this PID value,
      Several -p or --pid options may be specified.
      Without -p or --pid option, all PID's are used (this can be a
      dangerous option on complete transport streams since PID's not
      containing sections can be accidentally selected).

  --psi-si
      Add all PID's containing PSI/SI tables, ie. PAT, CAT, PMT, NIT, SDT
      and BAT. Note that EIT, TDT and TOT are not included. Use --pid 18
      to get EIT and --pid 20 to get TDT and TOT.

  -t value
  --tid value
      TID filter: select sections with this TID (table id) value.
      Several -t or --tid options may be specified.
      Without -t or --tid option, all tables are saved.

  -e value
  --tid-ext value
      TID extension filter: select sections with this table id
      extension value (apply to long sections only).
      Several -e or --tid-ext options may be specified.
      Without -e or --tid-ext option, all tables are saved.

  --time-stamp
      Display a time stamp (current local time) with each table.

  --ttl value
      With --ip-udp, specifies the TTL (Time-To-Live) socket option.
      The actual option is either "Unicast TTL" or "Multicast TTL",
      depending on the destination address. Remember that the default
      Multicast TTL is 1 on most systems.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the version number.

  --xml-output filename
      Save the tables in XML format in the specified file. To output the XML
      text on the standard output, explicitly specify this option with "-"
      as output file name.

Tables and sections formatting options:

  -c
  --c-style
      Same as --raw-dump (no interpretation of section) but dump the
      bytes in C-language style.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting DVB strings without
      explicit character table code. According to DVB standard ETSI EN 300 468,
      the default DVB character set is ISO-6937. However, some bogus
      signalization may assume that the default character set is different,
      typically the usual local character table for the region. This option
      forces a non-standard character table. The available table names are:
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5,
      ISO-8859-6, ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret private descriptors.
      The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not case-sensitive):
      Nagra, TPS, EACEM, EICTA, Logiways, CanalPlus, Eutelsat.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use ISO-8859-15
      instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --nested-tlv[=min-size]
      With option --tlv, try to interpret the value field of each TLV record as
      another TLV area. If the min-size value is specified, the nested TLV
      interpretation is performed only on value fields larger than this size.
      The syntax of the nested TLV is the same as the enclosing TLV.

  -r
  --raw-dump
      Raw dump of section, no interpretation.

  --tlv syntax
      For sections of unknown types, this option specifies how to interpret
      some parts of the section payload as TLV records. Several --tlv options
      are allowed, each one describes a part of the section payload.

      Each syntax string has the form "start,size,tagSize,lengthSize,order".
      The start and size fields define the offset and size of the TLV area
      in the section payload. If the size field is "auto", the TLV extends up
      to the end of the section. If the start field is "auto", the longest
      TLV area in the section payload will be used. The fields tagSize and
      lengthSize indicate the size in bytes of the Tag and Length fields in
      the TLV structure. The field order must be either "msb" or "lsb" and
      indicates the byte order of the Tag and Length fields.

      All fields are optional. The default values are "auto,auto,1,1,msb".
