Packetize PSI/SI sections in a transport stream PID

Usage: tspacketize [options] [input-file[=rate] ...]

Parameters:

  Input binary or XML files containing one or more sections or tables. By
  default, files ending in .xml are XML and files ending in .bin are binary.
  For other file names, explicitly specify --binary or --xml. If the file name
  is omitted, the standard input is used (binary by default, specify --xml
  otherwise).
  
  If different repetition rates are required for different files, a parameter
  can be "filename=value" where value is the repetition rate in milliseconds
  for all sections in that file. For repetition rates to be effective, the
  bitrate of the target PID must be specified, see option -b or --bitrate.

Options:

  --binary
      Specify that all input files are binary, regardless of their file name.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate (in bits/second) of the target PID. This
      information is used to schedule sections in the output list of packets
      when specific bitrates are specified for sections.

  -c
  --continuous
      Continuous packetization. By default, generate one cycle of sections.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -f
  --force-crc
      Force recomputation of CRC32 in long sections. Ignore the CRC32 values in
      the input files.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -o value
  --output value
      Output file name for TS packets. By default, use standard output.

  -p value
  --pid value
      PID of the output TS packets. This is a required parameter, there is no
      default value.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Insert stuffing at end of each section, up to the next TS packet
      boundary. By default, sections are packed and start in the middle of a TS
      packet, after the previous section. Note, however, that section headers
      are never scattered over a packet boundary.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.

  --xml
      Specify that all input files are XML, regardless of their file name.
