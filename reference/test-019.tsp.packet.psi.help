Extract PSI Information

Usage: tsp -P psi [options]

Options:

  -a
  --all-versions
      Display all versions of PSI tables (need to read the complete transport
      stream). By default, display only the first version of each PSI table and
      stop when all expected PSI are extracted.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  -c
  --c-style
      Same as --raw-dump (no interpretation of section) but dump the bytes in
      C-language style.

  --cat-only
      Display only the CAT, ignore other PSI tables.

  --clear
      Indicate that this is a clear transport stream, without conditional
      access information. Useful to avoid reading the complete transport
      stream, waiting for a non-existent CAT.

  --conax
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0B00.

  --default-cas-id value
      Interpret all EMM's and ECM's from unknown CAS as coming from the
      specified CA_System_Id. By default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted
      according to the CA_descriptor which references their PID. This option is
      useful when analyzing partial transport streams without CAT or PMT to
      correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting DVB strings without
      explicit character table code. According to DVB standard ETSI EN 300 468,
      the default DVB character set is ISO-6937. However, some bogus
      signalization may assume that the default character set is different,
      typically the usual local character table for the region. This option
      forces a non-standard character table. The available table names are
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret private descriptors.
      The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not case-sensitive) names.
      Must be one of "CanalPlus", "EACEM", "EICTA", "Eutelsat", "Logiways",
      "Nagra", "TPS".

  -d
  --dump
      Dump all PSI sections.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --exclude-current
      Exclude PSI tables with "current" indicator. This is rarely necessary.
      See also --include-next.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --include-next
      Include PSI tables with "next" indicator. By default, they are excluded.

  --irdeto
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0600.

  --mediaguard
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0100.

  --nagravision
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x1800.

  --nds
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0900.

  --nested-tlv[=min-size]
      With option --tlv, try to interpret the value field of each TLV record as
      another TLV area. If the min-size value is specified, the nested TLV
      interpretation is performed only on value fields larger than this size.
      The syntax of the nested TLV is the same as the enclosing TLV.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -o value
  --output-file value
      File name for text output.

  -r
  --raw-dump
      Raw dump of section, no interpretation.

  --safeaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4ADC.

  --tlv value
      For sections of unknown types, this option specifies how to interpret
      some parts of the section payload as TLV records. Several --tlv options
      are allowed, each one describes a part of the section payload.
      
      Each syntax string has the form "start,size,tagSize,lengthSize,order".
      The start and size fields define the offset and size of the TLV area in
      the section payload. If the size field is "auto", the TLV extends up to
      the end of the section. If the start field is "auto", the longest TLV
      area in the section payload will be used. The fields tagSize and
      lengthSize indicate the size in bytes of the Tag and Length fields in the
      TLV structure. The field order must be either "msb" or "lsb" and
      indicates the byte order of the Tag and Length fields.
      
      All fields are optional. The default values are "auto,auto,1,1,msb".

  --viaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0500.

  --widevine
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4AD4.
