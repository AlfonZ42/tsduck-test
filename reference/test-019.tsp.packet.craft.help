Craft specific low-level transformations on packets

Usage: tsp -P craft [options]

This plugin modifies precise fields in all TS packets. Some operations may need
space in the adaptation field. By default, the payload is left unmodified and a
transformation is rejected if it needs to enlarge the adaptation field since
this would destroy part of the existing payload. Enlarging the adaptation field
is possible only when --payload-pattern is specified, in which case the payload
is overwritten anyway.

Options:

  --clear-discontinuity
      Clear the discontinuity_indicator in the packets.

  --clear-error
      Clear the transport_error_indicator in the packets.

  --clear-es-priority
      Clear the elementary_stream_priority_indicator in the packets.

  --clear-priority
      Clear the transport_priority flag in the packets.

  --clear-pusi
      Clear the payload_unit_start_indicator in the packets.

  --clear-random-access
      Clear the random_access_indicator in the packets.

  --continuity-counter value
      Specify the value of the continuity_counter field.

  --discontinuity
      Set the discontinuity_indicator in the packets. Space is required in the
      adaptation field.

  --error
      Set the transport_error_indicator in the packets.

  --es-priority
      Set the elementary_stream_priority_indicator in the packets. Space is
      required in the adaptation field.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --no-opcr
      Remove the OPCR from the packets.

  --no-payload
      Remove the payload, equivalent to --payload-size 0.

  --no-pcr
      Remove the PCR from the packets.

  --no-private-data
      Remove the private data from adaptation field.

  --no-splice-countdown
      Remove the splicing point from the packets.

  --offset-pattern value
      Specify starting offset in payload when using --payload-pattern. By
      default, the pattern replacement starts at the beginning of the packet
      payload.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  --opcr value
      Set this OPCR value in the packets. Space is required in the adaptation
      field.

  --pack-pes-header
      When a TS packet contains the start of a PES packet and the header of
      this PES packet contains stuffing, shift the TS payload to remove all
      possible stuffing from the PES header. Create TS stuffing in the
      adaptation field to compensate.

  --payload-pattern value
      Overwrite the payload and specify the binary pattern to apply. The value
      must be a string of hexadecimal digits specifying any number of bytes.
      The pattern is repeated to fill the payload.

  --payload-size size
      Resize the packet payload to the specified value in bytes. When
      necessary, an adaptation field is created or enlarged. Without
      --payload-pattern, the existing payload is either shrunk or enlarged.
      When an existing payload is shrunk, the end of the payload is truncated.
      When an existing payload is enlarged, its end is padded with 0xFF bytes.

  --pcr value
      Set this PCR value in the packets. Space is required in the adaptation
      field.

  --pes-payload
      With this option, the modified payload is the PES payload, not the TS
      payload. When the TS packet does not contain the start of a PES packet,
      the TS payload is not modified. With --payload-size, the TS payload is
      resized so that the part of the PES payload which is in the TS packet
      gets the specified size. With --payload-pattern and --offset-pattern, the
      pattern is applied inside the PES payload.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Modify the PID to the specified value.

  --priority
      Set the transport_priority flag in the packets.

  --private-data value
      Specify the binary content of the transport_private_data in the
      adaptation field. The value must be a string of hexadecimal digits
      specifying any number of bytes. Space is required in the adaptation
      field.

  --pusi
      Set the payload_unit_start_indicator in the packets.

  --random-access
      Set the random_access_indicator in the packets. Space is required in the
      adaptation field.

  --scrambling value
      Specify the value of the transport_scrambling_control field.

  --splice-countdown value
      Create a splicing point and set this splice countdown value in the
      packets. Space is required in the adaptation field.
