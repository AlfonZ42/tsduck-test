Zap on one service: Produce an SPTS containing only the specified service.

Usage: tsp -P zap [options] service

Service:

  decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it
  is interpreted as a service name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not
  case sensitive and blanks are ignored. If the input TS does not contain an
  SDT, use a service id.
