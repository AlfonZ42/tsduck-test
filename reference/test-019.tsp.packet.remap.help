Generic PID remapper

Usage: tsp -P remap [options] [pid[-pid]=newpid ...]

Parameters:

  Each remapping is specified as "pid=newpid" or "pid1-pid2=newpid" (all PID's
  can be specified as decimal or hexadecimal values). In the first form, the
  PID "pid" is remapped to "newpid". In the latter form, all PID's within the
  range "pid1" to "pid2" (inclusive) are respectively remapped to "newpid",
  "newpid"+1, etc.

Options:

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -n
  --no-psi
      Do not modify the PSI. By default, the PAT, CAT and PMT's are modified so
      that previous references to the remapped PID's will point to the new PID
      values.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -u
  --unchecked
      Do not perform any consistency checking while remapping PID's. Remapping
      to or from a predefined PID is accepted. Remapping two PID's to the same
      PID or to a PID which is already present in the input is accepted. Note
      that this option should be used with care since the resulting stream can
      be illegal or inconsistent.
