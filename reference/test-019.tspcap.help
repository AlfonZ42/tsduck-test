Analyze pcap and pcap-ng files

Usage: tspcap [options] [input-file]

Parameter:

  Input file in pcap or pcap-ng format, typically as saved by Wireshark. Use
  the standard input if no file name is specified.

Options:

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -d [address][:port]
  --destination [address][:port]
      Filter IPv4 packets based on the specified destination socket address.
      The optional port number is used for TCP and UDP packets only.

  --first-date date-time
      Filter packets starting at the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:
      mm:ss.mmm.

  --first-packet value
      Filter packets starting at the specified number. The packet numbering
      counts all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at
      1. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --first-timestamp micro-seconds
      Filter packets starting at the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from
      the beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark
      in the "Time" column (in seconds).

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i micro-seconds
  --interval micro-seconds
      Print a summary of exchanged data by intervals of times in micro-seconds.

  --last-date date-time
      Filter packets up to the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:mm:ss.
      mmm.

  --last-packet value
      Filter packets up to the specified number. The packet numbering counts
      all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at 1. This
      is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --last-timestamp micro-seconds
      Filter packets up to the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from the
      beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in
      the "Time" column (in seconds).

  -l
  --list-streams
      List all data streams. A data streams is made of all packets from one
      source to one destination using one protocol.

  -o
  --others
      Filter packets from "other" protocols, i.e. neither TCP nor UDP.

  -s [address][:port]
  --source [address][:port]
      Filter IPv4 packets based on the specified source socket address. The
      optional port number is used for TCP and UDP packets only.

  -t
  --tcp
      Filter TCP packets.

  -u
  --udp
      Filter UDP packets.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.
