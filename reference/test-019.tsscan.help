DVB network scanning utility.

Usage: tsscan [options]

If tuning parameters are present (frequency or channel reference), the NIT is
read on the specified frequency and a full scan of the corresponding network is
performed.

By default, without specific frequency, an UHF-band scanning is performed.

Options:

  --best-quality
      With UHF-band scanning, for each channel, use the offset with the
      best signal quality. By default, use the average of lowest and highest
      offsets with required minimum quality and strength.

  --best-strength
      With UHF-band scanning, for each channel, use the offset with the
      best signal strength. By default, use the average of lowest and highest
      offsets with required minimum quality and strength.

  --first-uhf-channel value
      For UHF-band scanning, specify the first channel to scan (default: 21).

  --first-offset value
      For UHF-band scanning, specify the first offset to scan (default: -2)
      on each channel.

  -g
  --global-service-list
      Same as --service-list but display a global list of services at the end
      of scanning instead of per transport stream.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --last-uhf-channel value
      For UHF-band scanning, specify the last channel to scan (default: 69).

  --last-offset value
      For UHF-band scanning, specify the last offset to scan (default: +2)
      on each channel.

  --min-quality value
      Minimum signal quality percentage. Frequencies with lower signal
      quality are ignored (default: 10%).

  --min-strength value
      Minimum signal strength percentage. Frequencies with lower signal
      strength are ignored (default: 10%).

  -n
  --no-offset
      For UHF-band scanning, scan only the central frequency of each channel.
      Do not scan frequencies with offsets.

  --psi-timeout milliseconds
      Specifies the timeout, in milli-seconds, for PSI/SI table collection.
      Useful only with --service-list. The default is 10,000 milli-seconds.

  -l
  --service-list
      Read SDT of each channel and display the list of services.

  --show-modulation
      Display modulation parameters when possible.

  -u
  --uhf-band
      Perform a complete DVB-T UHF-band scanning. Do not use the NIT.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the version number.

Tuner identification:

  -a N
  --adapter N
      Specifies the Linux DVB adapter N (/dev/dvb/adapterN).
      This option can be used instead of device name.

  -d "name"
  --device-name "name"
      Specify the DVB receiver device name, /dev/dvb/adapterA[:F[:M[:V]]]
      where A = adapter number, F = frontend number (default: 0), M = demux
      number (default: 0), V = dvr number (default: 0).
      By default, the first DVB receiver device is used.
      Use the tslsdvb utility to list all DVB devices.

Tuner reception parameters:

  --demux-buffer-size value
      Default buffer size, in bytes, of the demux device.
      The default is 1 MB.

  --receive-timeout milliseconds
      Specifies the timeout, in milliseconds, for each receive operation.
      To disable the timeout and wait indefinitely for packets, specify zero.
      This is the default.

  --signal-timeout seconds
      Specifies the timeout, in seconds, for DVB signal locking. If no signal
      is detected after this timeout, the command aborts. To disable the
      timeout and wait indefinitely for the signal, specify zero. The default
      is 5 seconds.

Tuning:

  By default, no tuning is performed on the DVB frontend. The transponder
  on which the frontend is currently tuned is used. There are three ways to
  specify a new transponder: specifying individual tuning options, a global
  tuning information string using the Linux DVB "zap" format, the name of
  a channel contained in the transponder (with appropriate channel
  configuration files).

Tuning options using Linux DVB "zap" format:

  --tune string
      Specifies all tuning information for the transponder in one string.
      As such, this option is incompatible with the individual tuning options,
      except "local" (non-transponder) options --lnb and --satellite-number.
      The format of the parameter string depends on the DVB frontend type.
      It is the same format as used in the Linux DVB szap/czap/tzap
      configuration files:

      Satellite (QPSK): "freq:pol:satnum:symrate"
        With freq = frequency in MHz, pol = polarity (either v or h), satnum =
        satellite number, symrate = symbol rate in ksym/s.

      Cable (QAM): "freq:inv:symrate:conv:mod"
        With freq = frequency in Hz, inv = inversion (one of INVERSION_OFF,
        INVERSION_ON, INVERSION_AUTO), symrate = symbol rate in sym/s, conv =
        convolutional rate (one of FEC_NONE, FEC_1_2, FEC_2_3, FEC_3_4,
        FEC_4_5, FEC_5_6, FEC_6_7, FEC_7_8, FEC_8_9, FEC_AUTO),
        mod = modulation (one of QPSK, QAM_16, QAM_32, QAM_64, QAM_128,
        QAM_256, QAM_AUTO).

      Terrestrial (OFDM): "freq:inv:bw:convhp:convlp:modu:mode:guard:hier"
        With freq = frequency in Hz, inv = inversion (one of INVERSION_OFF,
        INVERSION_ON, INVERSION_AUTO), bw = bandwidth (one of BANDWIDTH_8_MHZ,
        BANDWIDTH_7_MHZ, BANDWIDTH_6_MHZ, BANDWIDTH_AUTO), convhp and convlp =
        convolutional rate for high and low priority (see values in cable),
        modu = modulation (see values in cable), mode = transmission mode
        (one of TRANSMISSION_MODE_2K, TRANSMISSION_MODE_8K, 
        TRANSMISSION_MODE_AUTO), guard = guard interval (one of
        GUARD_INTERVAL_1_32, GUARD_INTERVAL_1_16, GUARD_INTERVAL_1_8,
        GUARD_INTERVAL_1_4, GUARD_INTERVAL_AUTO), hier = hierarchy (one of
        HIERARCHY_NONE, HIERARCHY_1, HIERARCHY_2, HIERARCHY_4, HIERARCHY_AUTO).

Locating the transponder by channel name:

  -c name
  --channel-transponder name
      Tune to the transponder containing the specified channel. The channel
      name is not case-sensitive and blanks are ignored. The channel is searched
      in a "zap configuration file" and the corresponding tuning information
      in this file is used.

  -z path
  --zap-config-file path
      Zap configuration file to use for option -c or --channel-transponder.
      The format of these text files is specified by the Linux DVB szap, czap
      and tzap utilities. Zap config files can be created using the scandvb
      tool (szap, czap, tzap and scandvb are part of the dvb-apps package).
      The location of the default zap configuration file depends on the system.
      - On Linux, the default file is $HOME/.Xzap/channels.conf, where X is
        either 's' (satellite), 'c' (cable) or 't' (terrestrial), depending
        on the frontend type.
      - On Windows, the default file is %APPDATA%\tsduck\Xzap\channels.conf,
        where X is either 's', 'c' or 't'.
