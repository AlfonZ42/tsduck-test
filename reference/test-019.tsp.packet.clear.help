Extract clear (non scrambled) sequences of a transport stream

Usage: tsp -P clear [options]

Options:

  -a
  --audio
      Check only audio PIDs for clear packets. By default, audio and video PIDs
      are checked.

  -d value
  --drop-after-packets value
      Specifies the number of packets after the last clear packet to wait
      before stopping the packet transmission. By default, stop 1 second after
      the last clear packet (based on current bitrate).

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -s value
  --service value
      The extraction of clear sequences is based on one "reference" service.
      (see option -s). When a clear packet is found on any audio or video
      stream of the reference service, all packets in the TS are transmitted.
      When no clear packet has been found in the last second, all packets in
      the TS are dropped.
      
      This option specifies the reference service. If the argument is an
      integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a
      service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name, as specified
      in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are ignored. If
      this option is not specified, the first service in the PAT is used.

  --stuffing
      Replace excluded packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing
      them. Useful to preserve bitrate.

  -v
  --video
      Check only video PIDs for clear packets. By default, audio and video PIDs
      are checked.
