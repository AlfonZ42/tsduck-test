PSI/SI tables compiler

Usage: tstabcomp [options] filename ...

Parameters:

  XML source files to compile or binary table files to decompile. By default,
  files ending in .xml are compiled and files ending in .bin are decompiled.
  For other files, explicitly specify --compile or --decompile.

Options:

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15 --time-reference
      UTC-3'. This is a handy shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb
      transport streams.

  -c
  --compile
      Compile all files as XML source files into binary files. This is the
      default for .xml files.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -d
  --decompile
      Decompile all files as binary files into XML files. This is the default
      for .bin files.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --eit-base-date date
      With --eit-normalization, use the specified date as "last midnight"
      reference for the allocation of the various EIT events in sections and
      segments. The date must be in the format "year/month/day". By default,
      use the oldest date in all EIT sections as base date.

  --eit-normalization
      Reorganize all EIT sections according to ETSI TS 101 211 rules. One
      single EIT p/f subtable is built per service. It is split in two
      sections, one for present and one for following events. All EIT schedule
      are kept but they are completely reorganized. All events are extracted
      and spread over new EIT sections according to ETSI TS 101 211 rules. If
      several files are specified, the reorganization of EIT's is performed
      inside each file independently. This is fine as long as all EIT's for a
      given service are in the same input file. See also option
      --eit-base-date.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  -e
  --extensions
      With --xml-model, include the content of the available extensions.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset ARIB-STD-B24 --time-reference
      JST'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Japanese transport
      streams.

  -o filepath
  --output filepath
      Specify the output file name. By default, the output file has the same
      name as the input and extension .bin (compile) or .xml (decompile). If
      the specified path is a directory, the output file is built from this
      directory and default file name. If more than one input file is
      specified, the output path, if present, must be a directory name.

  --pack-and-flush
      When loading a binary section file, pack incomplete tables and flush
      them. Sections are renumbered to remove any hole between sections. Use
      with care because this may create inconsistent tables.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset RAW-UTF-8 --time-reference
      UTC+8'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Philippines transport
      streams.

  --strict-xml
      Save XML documents in strictly conformant XML format. By default, do not
      escape characters when this is not syntactically necessary to make the
      XML text more human-readable.

  --time-reference name
      Use a non-standard (non-UTC) time reference in TDT/TOT. This is typically
      used in ARIB ISDB and ABNT ISDB-Tb standards. The specified name can be
      either 'UTC', 'JST' (Japan Standard Time) or 'UTC+|-hh[:mm]'. Examples:
      'UTC+9' (same as 'JST' for ARIB ISDB), 'UTC-3' (for ABNT ISDB-Tb in
      Brazil).

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.

  -x
  --xml-model
      Display the XML model of the table files. This model is not a full
      XML-Schema, this is an informal template file which describes the
      expected syntax of TSDuck XML files. If --output is specified, save the
      model here. Do not specify input files.
