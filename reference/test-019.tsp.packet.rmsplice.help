Remove ads insertions from a program using SCTE 35 splice information

Usage: tsp -P rmsplice [options] [service]

Parameter:

  Specifies the service to modify. If the argument is an integer value (either
  decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is
  interpreted as a service name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case
  sensitive and blanks are ignored. If the input TS does not contain an SDT,
  use a service id. When omitted, the first service in the PAT is used.

Options:

  -a
  --adjust-time
      Adjust all time stamps (PCR, OPCR, PTS and DTS) after removing
      splice-out/in sequences. This can be necessary to improve the video
      transition.

  -c
  --continue
      Continue stream processing even if no "splice information stream" is
      found for the service. Without this information stream, we cannot remove
      ads. By default, abort when the splice information stream is not found in
      the PMT.

  -n
  --dry-run
      Perform a dry run, report what operations would be performed. Use with
      --verbose.

  --event-id value
      Only remove splices associated with event ID. Several --event-id options
      may be specified.

  -f
  --fix-cc
      Fix continuity counters after removing splice-out/in sequences.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Replace excluded packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing
      them. Useful to preserve bitrate.
