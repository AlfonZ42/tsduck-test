Read TS packets from a pcap or pcap-ng file

Usage: tsp -I pcap [options] [file-name]

Parameter:

  The name of a '.pcap' or '.pcapng' capture file as produced by Wireshark for
  instance. This input plugin extracts IPv4 UDP datagrams which contain
  transport stream packets. Use the standard input by default, when no file
  name is specified.

Options:

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --timestamp-priority name
      Specify how the input time-stamp of each packet is computed. The name
      specifies an ordered list. The first available time-stamp value is used
      as input time-stamp. The possible time-stamp sources are:
      - rtp : The RTP time stamp, when the UDP packet is an RTP packet.
      - pcap : pcap capture time stamp.
      - tsp : A software time-stamp, provided by tsp when the input plugin
      returns a chunk of packets.
      The tsp-provided time-stamp is always available, always comes last and is
      less precise. The default is rtp-pcap-tsp.
      Must be one of "pcap-rtp-tsp", "pcap-tsp", "rtp-pcap-tsp", "rtp-tsp",
      "tsp".
